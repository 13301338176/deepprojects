## NLP
Following on from my thread about intro #NLProc textbooks, I thought I'd make a thread about #NLProc video lectures that are available online. This will probably be shorter, as I'm only aware of a handful, but I hope people can give me pointers to others.

- @nlpnoah of UW and the Allen Institute for AI has videos from his 2017 course available [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep517/17sp/video/)
- @jurafsky @chrmanning have a lecture playlist on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiyVNMpDLKnZYBTUOlSI9mi9wAErFtFm)
- Microsoft has an #NLProc course available through edX [here](https://www.edx.org/course/natural-language-processing-3)
- Coursera currently has one #NLProc course, which you can audit. [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing)
- Dragomir Radev and Michael Collins have each previously had Coursera #NLProc courses that are no longer available. Drago's lectures (2015) are available on YouTube. [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK8BdawOVCCaTCO99Ya58ryR)  haven't found Michael Collins' lectures (2013) archived anywhere. Give me a shout if you know where they are!
- @chrmanning also has lectures on deep learning for natural language processing up on YouTube. [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6)
- Advanced course on deep learning for #NLProc from Oxford and DeepMind, with a variety of instructors including @egrefen and @redpony. [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL613dYIGMXoZBtZhbyiBqb0QtgK6oJbpm)
