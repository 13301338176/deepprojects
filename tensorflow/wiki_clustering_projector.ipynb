              "array([['the greek alphabet has been used to write the greek language since the late ninth or early eighth century bc. it is derived from the earlier phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script in history to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. in archaic and early classical times, the greek alphabet existed in many different local variants, but, by the end of the fourth century bc, the euclidean alphabet, with twenty-four letters, ordered from alpha to omega, had become standard and it is this version that is still used to write greek today. these twenty-four letters (each in uppercase and lowercase forms) are: α α, β β, γ γ, δ δ, ε ε, ζ ζ, η η, θ θ, ι ι, κ κ, λ λ, μ μ, ν ν, ξ ξ, ο ο, π π, ρ ρ, σ σ/ς, τ τ, υ υ, φ φ, χ χ, ψ ψ, and ω ω.\\nthe greek alphabet is the ancestor of the latin and cyrillic scripts. like latin and cyrillic, greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between uppercase and lowercase in parallel with latin during the modern era. sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between ancient and modern greek usage, because the pronunciation of greek has changed significantly between the fifth century bc and today. modern and ancient greek also use different diacritics. apart from its use in writing the greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.\\n\\n\\n== letters ==\\n\\n\\n=== sound values ===\\n\\nin both ancient and modern greek, the letters of the greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. ancient greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. for a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between ancient and modern greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.\\nexamples\\nnotes\\namong consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants (/b, d, g/) and aspirated plosives (/pʰ, tʰ, kʰ/) in ancient greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in modern greek. the correspondences are as follows:\\n\\namong the vowel symbols, modern greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. this leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. modern greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. as a consequence, the spellings of words in modern greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable.\\nthe following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers:\\n\\nmodern greek speakers typically use the same, modern symbol–sound mappings in reading greek of all historical stages. in other countries, students of ancient greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing ancient greek.\\n\\n\\n=== digraphs and letter combinations ===\\nseveral letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized. in addition to the four mentioned above (⟨ει, αι, οι, υι,⟩), there is also ⟨ηι, ωι⟩, and ⟨ου⟩, pronounced /u/. the ancient greek diphthongs ⟨αυ⟩, ⟨ευ⟩ and ⟨ηυ⟩ are pronounced [av], [ev] and [iv] in modern greek. in some environments, they are devoiced to [af], [ef] and [if] respectively. the modern greek consonant combinations ⟨μπ⟩ and ⟨ντ⟩ stand for [b] and [d] (or [mb] and [nd]) respectively; ⟨τζ⟩ stands for [dz] and ⟨τσ⟩ stands for [t͡s]. in addition, both in ancient and modern greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩, before another velar consonant, stands for the velar nasal [ŋ]; thus ⟨γγ⟩ and ⟨γκ⟩ are pronounced like english ⟨ng⟩. in analogy to ⟨μπ⟩ and ⟨ντ⟩, ⟨γκ⟩ is also used to stand for [g]. there are also the combinations ⟨γχ⟩ and ⟨γξ⟩.\\n\\n\\n=== diacritics ===\\n\\nin the polytonic orthography traditionally used for ancient greek, the stressed vowel of each word carries one of three accent marks: either the acute accent (ά), the grave accent (ὰ), or the circumflex accent (α̃ or α̑). these signs were originally designed to mark different forms of the phonological pitch accent in ancient greek. by the time their use became conventional and obligatory in greek writing, in late antiquity, pitch accent was evolving into a single stress accent, and thus the three signs have not corresponded to a phonological distinction in actual speech ever since. in addition to the accent marks, every word-initial vowel must carry either of two so-called \"breathing marks\": the rough breathing (ἁ), marking an /h/ sound at the beginning of a word, or the smooth breathing (ἀ), marking its absence. the letter rho (ρ), although not a vowel, also carries a rough breathing in word-initial position. if a rho was geminated within a word, the first ρ always had the smooth breathing and the second the rough breathing (ῤῥ) leading to the transliteration rrh.\\nthe vowel letters ⟨α, η, ω⟩ carry an additional diacritic in certain words, the so-called iota subscript, which has the shape of a small vertical stroke or a miniature ⟨ι⟩ below the letter. this iota represents the former offglide of what were originally long diphthongs, ⟨ᾱι, ηι, ωι⟩ (i.e. /aːi, ɛːi, ɔːi/), which became monophthongized during antiquity.\\nanother diacritic used in greek is the diaeresis (¨), indicating a hiatus.\\nthis system of diacritics was first developed by the scholar aristophanes of byzantium (c.\\u2009257 – c.\\u2009185/180 bc), who worked at the musaeum in alexandria during the third century bc. aristophanes of byzantium also was the first to divide poems into lines, rather than writing them like prose, and also introduced a series of signs for textual criticism. in 1982, a new, simplified orthography, known as \"monotonic\", was adopted for official use in modern greek by the greek state. it uses only a single accent mark, the acute (also known in this context as tonos, i.e. simply \"accent\"), marking the stressed syllable of polysyllabic words, and occasionally the diaeresis to distinguish diphthongal from digraph readings in pairs of vowel letters, making this monotonic system very similar to the accent mark system used in spanish. the polytonic system is still conventionally used for writing ancient greek, while in some book printing and generally in the usage of conservative writers it can still also be found in use for modern greek.\\nalthough it is not a diacritic, the comma has a similar function as a silent letter in a handful of greek words, principally distinguishing ό,τι (ó,ti, \"whatever\") from ότι (óti, \"that\").\\n\\n\\n=== romanization ===\\n\\nthere are many different methods of rendering greek text or greek names in the latin script. the form in which classical greek names are conventionally rendered in english goes back to the way greek loanwords were incorporated into latin in antiquity. in this system, ⟨κ⟩ is replaced with ⟨c⟩, the diphthongs ⟨αι⟩ and ⟨οι⟩ are rendered as ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ (or ⟨æ,œ⟩) respectively; and ⟨ει⟩ and ⟨ου⟩ are simplified to ⟨i⟩ and ⟨u⟩ respectively. smooth breathing marks are usually ignored and rough breathing marks are usually rendered as the letter ⟨h⟩. in modern scholarly transliteration of ancient greek, ⟨κ⟩ will usually be rendered as ⟨k⟩, and the vowel combinations ⟨αι, οι, ει, ου⟩ as ⟨ai, oi, ei, ou⟩ respectively. the letters ⟨θ⟩ and ⟨φ⟩ are generally rendered as ⟨th⟩ and ⟨ph⟩; ⟨χ⟩ as either ⟨ch⟩ or ⟨kh⟩; and word-initial ⟨ρ⟩ as ⟨rh⟩.multiple different transcription conventions exist for modern greek. these differ widely, depending on their purpose, on how close they stay to the conventional letter correspondences of ancient greek-based transcription systems, and to what degree they attempt either an exact letter-by-letter transliteration or rather a phonetically-based transcription. standardized formal transcription systems have been defined by the international organization for standardization (as iso 843), by the united nations group of experts on geographical names, by the library of congress, and others.\\n\\n\\n== history ==\\n\\n\\n=== origins ===\\n\\nduring the mycenaean period, from around the sixteenth century to the twelfth century bc, linear b was used to write the earliest attested form of the greek language, known as mycenaean greek. this writing system, unrelated to the greek alphabet, last appeared in the thirteenth century bc. in the late ninth century bc or early eighth century bc, the greek alphabet emerged. the period between the use of the two writing systems, during which no greek texts are attested, is known as the greek dark ages. the greeks adopted the alphabet from the earlier phoenician alphabet, one of the closely related scripts used for the west semitic languages, calling it φοινικήια γράμματα \\'phoenician letters\\'. however, the phoenician alphabet is limited to consonants. when it was adopted for writing greek, certain consonants were adapted to express vowels. the use of both vowels and consonants makes greek the first alphabet in the narrow sense, as distinguished from the abjads used in semitic languages, which have letters only for consonants.\\n\\ngreek initially took over all of the 22 letters of phoenician. five were reassigned to denote vowel sounds: the glide consonants /j/ (yodh) and /w/ (waw) were used for [i] (ι, iota) and [u] (υ, upsilon) respectively; the glottal stop consonant /ʔ/ (aleph) was used for [a] (α, alpha); the pharyngeal /ʕ/ (ʿayin) was turned into [o] (ο, omicron); and the letter for /h/ (he) was turned into [e] (ε, epsilon). a doublet of waw was also borrowed as a consonant for [w] (ϝ, digamma). in addition, the phoenician letter for the emphatic glottal /ħ/ (heth) was borrowed in two different functions by different dialects of greek: as a letter for /h/ (η, heta) by those dialects that had such a sound, and as an additional vowel letter for the long /ɛː/ (η, eta) by those dialects that lacked the consonant. eventually, a seventh vowel letter for the long /ɔː/ (ω, omega) was introduced.\\ngreek also introduced three new consonant letters for its aspirated plosive sounds and consonant clusters: φ (phi) for /pʰ/, χ (chi) for /kʰ/ and ψ (psi) for /ps/. in western greek variants, χ was instead used for /ks/ and ψ for /kʰ/. the origin of these letters is a matter of some debate.\\n\\nthree of the original phoenician letters dropped out of use before the alphabet took its classical shape: the letter ϻ (san), which had been in competition with σ (sigma) denoting the same phoneme /s/; the letter ϙ (qoppa), which was redundant with κ (kappa) for /k/, and ϝ (digamma), whose sound value /w/ dropped out of the spoken language before or during the classical period.\\ngreek was originally written predominantly from right to left, just like phoenician, but scribes could freely alternate between directions. for a time, a writing style with alternating right-to-left and left-to-right lines (called boustrophedon, literally \"ox-turning\", after the manner of an ox ploughing a field) was common, until in the classical period the left-to-right writing direction became the norm. individual letter shapes were mirrored depending on the writing direction of the current line.\\n\\n\\n=== archaic variants ===\\n\\nthere were initially numerous local (epichoric) variants of the greek alphabet, which differed in the use and non-use of the additional vowel and consonant symbols and several other features. epichoric alphabets are commonly divided into four major types according to their different treatments of additional consonant letters for the aspirated consonants (/pʰ, kʰ/) and consonant clusters (/ks, ps/) of greek. these four types are often conventionally labelled as \"green\", \"red\", \"light blue\" and \"dark blue\" types, based on a colour-coded map in a seminal 19th-century work on the topic, studien zur geschichte des griechischen alphabets by adolf kirchhoff (1867).the \"green\" (or southern) type is the most archaic and closest to the phoenician. the \"red\" (or western) type is the one that was later transmitted to the west and became the ancestor of the latin alphabet, and bears some crucial features characteristic of that later development. the \"blue\" (or eastern) type is the one from which the later standard greek alphabet emerged. athens used a local form of the \"light blue\" alphabet type until the end of the fifth century bc, which lacked the letters ξ and ψ as well as the vowel symbols η and ω. in the old attic alphabet, χς stood for /ks/ and φς for /ps/. ε was used for all three sounds /e, eː, ɛː/ (correspondinɡ to classical ε, ει, η respectively), and ο was used for all of /o, oː, ɔː/ (corresponding to classical ο, ου, ω respectively). the letter η (heta) was used for the consonant /h/. some variant local letter forms were also characteristic of athenian writing, some of which were shared with the neighboring (but otherwise \"red\") alphabet of euboia: a form of λ that resembled a latin l () and a form of σ that resembled a latin s ().\\n*upsilon is also derived from waw ().\\nthe classical twenty-four-letter alphabet that is now used to represent the greek language was originally the local alphabet of ionia. by the late fifth century bc, it was commonly used by many athenians. in c. 403 bc, at the suggestion of the archon eucleides, the athenian assembly formally abandoned the old attic alphabet and adopted the ionian alphabet as part of the democratic reforms after the overthrow of the thirty tyrants. because of eucleides\\'s role in suggesting the idea to adopt the ionian alphabet, the standard twenty-four-letter greek alphabet is sometimes known as the \"eucleidean alphabet\". roughly thirty years later, the eucleidean alphabet was adopted in boeotia and it may have been adopted a few years previously in macedonia. by the end of the fourth century bc, it had displaced local alphabets across the greek-speaking world to become the standard form of the greek alphabet.\\n\\n\\n=== letter names ===\\nwhen the greeks adopted the phoenician alphabet, they took over not only the letter shapes and sound values, but also the names by which the sequence of the alphabet could be recited and memorized. in phoenician, each letter name was a word that began with the sound represented by that letter; thus ʾaleph, the word for \"ox\", was used as the name for the glottal stop /ʔ/, bet, or \"house\", for the /b/ sound, and so on. when the letters were adopted by the greeks, most of the phoenician names were maintained or modified slightly to fit greek phonology; thus, ʾaleph, bet, gimel became alpha, beta, gamma.\\nthe greek names of the following letters are more or less straightforward continuations of their phoenician antecedents. between ancient and modern greek, they have remained largely unchanged, except that their pronunciation has followed regular sound changes along with other words (for instance, in the name of beta, ancient /b/ regularly changed to modern /v/, and ancient /ɛː/ to modern /i/, resulting in the modern pronunciation vita). the name of lambda is attested in early sources as λάβδα besides λάμβδα; in modern greek the spelling is often λάμδα, reflecting pronunciation. similarly, iota is sometimes spelled γιώτα in modern greek ([ʝ] is conventionally transcribed ⟨γ{ι,η,υ,ει,οι}⟩ word-initially and intervocalically before back vowels and /a/). in the tables below, the greek names of all letters are given in their traditional polytonic spelling; in modern practice, like with all other words, they are usually spelled in the simplified monotonic system.\\n\\nin the cases of the three historical sibilant letters below, the correspondence between phoenician and ancient greek is less clear, with apparent mismatches both in letter names and sound values. the early history of these letters (and the fourth sibilant letter, obsolete san) has been a matter of some debate. here too, the changes in the pronunciation of the letter names between ancient and modern greek are regular.\\n\\nin the following group of consonant letters, the older forms of the names in ancient greek were spelled with -εῖ, indicating an original pronunciation with -ē. in modern greek these names are spelled with -ι.\\n\\nthe following group of vowel letters were originally called simply by their sound values as long vowels: ē, ō, ū, and ɔ. their modern names contain adjectival qualifiers that were added during the byzantine period, to distinguish between letters that had become confusable. thus, the letters ⟨ο⟩ and ⟨ω⟩, pronounced identically by this time, were called o mikron (\"small o\") and o mega (\"big o\") respectively. the letter ⟨ε⟩ was called e psilon (\"plain e\") to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph ⟨αι⟩, while, similarly, ⟨υ⟩, which at this time was pronounced [y], was called y psilon (\"plain y\") to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph ⟨οι⟩.\\nsome dialects of the aegean and cypriot have retained long consonants and pronounce [ˈɣamːa] and [ˈkapʰa]; also, ήτα has come to be pronounced [ˈitʰa] in cypriot.\\n\\n\\n=== letter shapes ===\\n\\nlike latin and other alphabetic scripts, greek originally had only a single form of each letter, without a distinction between uppercase and lowercase. this distinction is an innovation of the modern era, drawing on different lines of development of the letter shapes in earlier handwriting.\\nthe oldest forms of the letters in antiquity are majuscule forms. besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in egypt since the hellenistic period. ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. the cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, as well as many connecting lines and ligatures between letters.\\nin the ninth and tenth century, uncial book hands were replaced with a new, more compact writing style, with letter forms partly adapted from the earlier cursive. this minuscule style remained the dominant form of handwritten greek into the modern era. during the renaissance, western printers adopted the minuscule letter forms as lowercase printed typefaces, while modelling uppercase letters on the ancient inscriptional forms. the orthographic practice of using the letter case distinction for marking proper names, titles etc. developed in parallel to the practice in latin and other western languages.\\n\\n\\n== derived alphabets ==\\n\\nthe greek alphabet was the model for various others:\\nthe etruscan alphabet;\\nthe latin alphabet, together with various other ancient scripts in italy, adopted from an archaic form of the greek alphabet brought to italy by greek colonists in the late 8th century bc, via etruscan;\\nthe gothic alphabet, devised in the 4th century ad to write the gothic language, based on a combination of greek and latin uncial models;\\nthe glagolitic alphabet, devised in the 9th century ad for writing old church slavonic;\\nthe cyrillic script, which replaced the glagolitic alphabet shortly afterwards.the armenian and georgian alphabets are almost certainly modeled on the greek alphabet, but their graphic forms are quite different.\\n\\n\\n== other uses ==\\n\\n\\n=== use for other languages ===\\napart from the daughter alphabets listed above, which were adapted from greek but developed into separate writing systems, the greek alphabet has also been adopted at various times and in various places to write other languages. for some of them, additional letters were introduced.\\n\\n\\n==== antiquity ====\\nmost of the alphabets of asia minor, in use c. 800–300 bc to write languages like lydian and phrygian, were the early greek alphabet with only slight modifications – as were the

spoken in what is now afghanistan, was written in the greek alphabet during the kushan empire (65–250 ad). it adds an extra letter ⟨þ⟩ for the sh sound [ʃ].\\nthe coptic alphabet adds eight letters derived from demotic. it is still used today, mostly in egypt, to write coptic, the liturgical language of egyptian christians. letters usually retain an uncial form different from the forms used for greek today.\\n\\n\\n==== middle ages ====\\nan 8th-century arabic fragment preserves a text in the greek alphabet.\\nan old ossetic inscription of the 10th–12th centuries found in arxyz, the oldest

used for the velar nasal sound.\\nvarious south slavic dialects, similar to the modern bulgarian and macedonian languages, have been written in greek script. the modern south slavic languages now use modified cyrillic alphabets.\\n\\n\\n==== early modern ====\\n\\nturkish spoken by orthodox christians (karamanlides) was often written in greek script, and called karamanlidika.\\ntosk albanian was often written using the greek alphabet, starting in about 1500. the printing press at moschopolis published several albanian texts in greek script during the 18th century. it was only in 1908 that the monastir conference standardized a latin orthography for both tosk and gheg. greek spelling is still occasionally used for the local albanian dialects (arvanitika) in greece.\\ngagauz, a turkic language of the northeast balkans, was apparently written in greek characters in the late 19th century.  in 1957, it was standardized on cyrillic, and in 1996, a gagauz alphabet based on latin characters was adopted (derived from the turkish alphabet).\\nsurguch, a turkic language, was spoken by a small group of orthodox christians in northern greece.  it is now written in latin or cyrillic characters.\\nurum or greek tatar used the greek alphabet.\\njudaeo-spanish language, a jewish dialect of spanish, has occasionally been published in greek characters in greece.\\n\\n\\n=== in

small positive number, lower case pi (π) for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, capital sigma (σ) for summation, and lower case sigma (σ) for standard deviation.\\n\\n\\n=== astronomy ===\\n\\ngreek letters are used to denote the brighter stars within each of the eighty-eight constellations. in most constellations, the brightest star is designated alpha and the next brightest beta etc. for example, the brightest star in the constellation of centaurus is known as alpha centauri. for historical reasons, the greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.\\n\\n\\n=== international phonetic alphabet ===\\nseveral greek letters are used as phonetic symbols in the international phonetic alphabet (ipa). several of them denote fricative consonants; the rest stand for variants of vowel sounds. the glyph shapes used for these letters in specialized phonetic fonts is sometimes slightly different from the conventional shapes in greek typography proper, with glyphs typically being more upright and using serifs, to make them conform more with the typographical character of other, latin-based letters in the phonetic alphabet. nevertheless, in the unicode encoding standard, the following three phonetic symbols are considered the same characters as the corresponding greek letters proper:\\non the other hand, the following phonetic letters have unicode representations separate from their greek alphabetic use, either because their conventional typographic shape is too different from the original, or because they also have secondary uses as regular alphabetic characters in some latin-based alphabets, including separate latin uppercase letters distinct from the greek ones.\\n\\nthe symbol in americanist phonetic notation for the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is the greek letter lambda ⟨λ⟩, but ⟨ɬ⟩ in the ipa. the ipa symbol for the palatal lateral approximant is ⟨ʎ⟩, which looks similar to lambda, but is actually an inverted lowercase y.\\n\\n\\n=== use as numerals ===\\n\\ngreek letters were also used to write numbers. in the classical ionian system, the first nine letters of the alphabet stood for the numbers from 1 to 9, the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 10, from 10 to 90, and the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 100, from 100 to 900. for this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters which by that time made up the standard alphabet, three otherwise obsolete letters were retained or revived: digamma ⟨ϝ⟩ for 6, koppa ⟨ϙ⟩ for 90, and a rare ionian letter for [ss], today called sampi ⟨ͳ⟩, for 900. this system has remained in use in greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way roman numerals are used in english. the three extra symbols are today written as ⟨ϛ⟩, ⟨ϟ⟩ and ⟨ϡ⟩ respectively. to mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called keraia is added to the right of it.\\n\\n\\n=== use by student fraternities and sororities ===\\nin north america, many college fraternities and sororities are named with combinations of greek letters, and are hence also known as \"greek letter organizations\". this naming tradition was initiated by the foundation of the phi beta kappa society at the college of william and mary in 1776. the name of this fraternal organization is an acronym for the ancient greek phrase φιλοσοφία βίου κυβερνήτης (philosophia biou kybernētēs), which means \"love of wisdom, the guide of life\" and serves as the organization\\'s motto. sometimes early fraternal organizations were known by their greek letter names because the mottos that these names stood for were secret and revealed only to members of the fraternity. the greek letter names of most fraternal organizations today are meaningless and do not stand for anything, which caroline winterer states is \"understandable, considering that general knowledge of the ancient greek alphabet and language has almost entirely vanished.\"different chapters within the same fraternity are almost always (with a handful of exceptions) designated using greek letters as serial numbers. the founding chapter of each respective organization is its a chapter. as an organization expands, it establishes a b chapter, a γ chapter, and so on and so forth. in an organization that expands to more than 24 chapters, the chapter after ω chapter is aa chapter, followed by ab chapter, etc. each of these is still a \"chapter letter\", albeit a double-digit letter just as 10 through 99 are double-digit numbers. the roman alphabet has a similar extended form with such double-digit letters when necessary, but it is used for columns in a table or chart rather than chapters of an organization.\\n\\n\\n== glyph variants ==\\nsome letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting. while their use in normal typography of greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in unicode.\\n\\nthe symbol ϐ (\"curled beta\") is a cursive variant form of beta (β). in the french tradition of ancient greek typography, β is used word-initially, and ϐ is used word-internally.\\nthe letter delta has a form resembling a cursive capital letter d; while not encoded as its own form, this form is included as part of the symbol for the drachma (a δρ digraph) in the currency symbols block, at u+20af (₯).\\nthe letter epsilon can occur in two equally frequent stylistic variants, either shaped \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ϵ\\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\epsilon \\\\,\\\\!}\\n   (\\'lunate epsilon\\', like a semicircle with a stroke) or \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ε\\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varepsilon \\\\,\\\\!}\\n   (similar to a reversed number 3). the symbol ϵ (u+03f5) is designated specifically for the lunate form, used as a technical symbol.\\nthe symbol ϑ (\"script theta\") is a cursive form of theta (θ), frequent in handwriting, and used with a specialized meaning as a technical symbol.\\nthe symbol ϰ (\"kappa symbol\") is a cursive form of kappa (κ), used as a technical symbol.\\nthe symbol ϖ (\"variant pi\") is an archaic script form of pi (π), also used as a technical symbol.\\nthe letter rho (ρ) can occur in different stylistic variants, with the descending tail either going straight down or curled to the right. the symbol ϱ (u+03f1) is designated specifically for the curled form, used as a technical symbol.\\nthe letter sigma, in standard orthography, has two variants: ς, used only at the ends of words, and σ, used elsewhere. the form ϲ (\"lunate sigma\", resembling a latin c) is a medieval stylistic variant that can be used in both environments without the final/non-final distinction.\\nthe capital letter upsilon (υ) can occur in different stylistic variants, with the upper strokes either straight like a latin y, or slightly curled. the symbol ϒ (u+03d2) is designated specifically for the curled form, (\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n        υ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\,\\\\upsilon }\\n  ) used as a technical symbol, e.g. in physics.\\nthe letter phi can occur in two equally frequent stylistic variants, either shaped as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          ϕ\\n          \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle \\\\phi \\\\,\\\\!}\\n   (a circle with a vertical stroke through it) or as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          φ\\n          \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle \\\\varphi \\\\,\\\\!}\\n   (a curled shape open at the top). the symbol ϕ (u+03d5) is designated specifically for the closed form, used as a technical symbol.\\nthe letter omega (ω) has at least three stylistic variants of its capital form. the \"open omega\", resembling an open partial circle with the opening downward and the ends curled outward, is the standard. the two other stylistic variants, seen more often in modern typography, resemble an underscored full circle, where the underscore may or may not be touching the circle on a tangent (in the former case it resembles a superscript omicron similar to that found in the numero sign or masculine ordinal indicator; in the latter, it closely resembles some forms of the latin letter q). the open omega is always used in symbolic settings and is encoded in letterlike symbols (u+2126) as a separate code point for backward compatibility.\\n\\n\\n== computer encodings ==\\nfor computer usage, a variety of encodings have been used for greek online, many of them documented in rfc 1947.\\nthe two principal ones still used today are iso/iec 8859-7 and unicode. iso 8859-7 supports only the monotonic orthography; unicode supports both the monotonic and polytonic orthographies.\\n\\n\\n=== iso/iec 8859-7 ===\\nfor the range a0–ff (hex), it follows the unicode range 370–3cf (see below) except that some symbols, like ©, ½, § etc. are used where unicode has unused locations. like all iso-8859 encodings, it is equal to ascii for 00–7f (hex).\\n\\n\\n=== greek in unicode ===\\n\\nunicode supports polytonic orthography well enough for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy. with the use of combining characters, unicode also supports greek philology and dialectology and various other specialized requirements. most current text rendering engines do not render diacritics well, so, though alpha with macron and acute can be represented as u+03b1 u+0304 u+0301, this rarely renders well: ᾱ́.there are two main blocks of greek characters in unicode. the first is \"greek and coptic\" (u+0370 to u+03ff). this block is based on iso 8859-7 and is sufficient to write modern greek. there are also some archaic letters and greek-based technical symbols.\\nthis block also supports the coptic alphabet. formerly, most coptic letters shared codepoints with similar-looking greek letters; but in many scholarly works, both scripts occur, with quite different letter shapes, so as of unicode 4.1, coptic and greek were disunified. those coptic letters with no greek equivalents still remain in this block (u+03e2 to u+03ef).\\nto write polytonic greek, one may use combining diacritical marks or the precomposed characters in the \"greek extended\" block (u+1f00 to u+1fff).\\n\\n\\n==== combining

              "       ['the industrial revolution, now also known as the first industrial revolution, was the transition to new manufacturing processes in europe and the united states, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. this transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. the industrial revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.\\ntextiles were the dominant industry of the industrial revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.the industrial revolution began in great britain, and many of the technological innovations were of british origin. by the mid-18th century britain was the world\\'s leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in north america and the caribbean, and with major military and political hegemony on the indian subcontinent, particularly with the proto-industrialised mughal bengal, through the activities of the east india company. the development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the industrial revolution.the industrial revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. in particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. some economists say that the major effect of the industrial revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.gdp per capita was broadly stable before the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the industrial revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the industrial revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants.although the structural change from agriculture to industry is widely associated with the industrial revolution, in the united kingdom it was already almost complete by 1760.the precise start and end of the industrial revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes. eric hobsbawm held that the industrial revolution began in britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while t. s. ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830. rapid industrialization first began in britain, starting with mechanized spinning in the 1780s, with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800.  mechanized textile production spread from great britain to continental europe and the united states in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in belgium and the united states and later textiles in france.an economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the industrial revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, hot blast iron smelting and new technologies, such as the electrical telegraph, widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth.  rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the second industrial revolution.  these new innovations included new steel making processes, mass-production, assembly lines, electrical grid systems, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.\\n\\n\\n== etymology ==\\nthe earliest recorded use of the term \"industrial revolution\" seems to have been in a letter from 6 july 1799 written by french envoy louis-guillaume otto, announcing that france had entered the race to industrialise. in his 1976 book keywords: a vocabulary of culture and society, raymond williams states in the entry for \"industry\": \"the idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in southey and owen, between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as blake in the early 1790s and wordsworth at the turn of the [19th] century.\" the term industrial revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in jérôme-adolphe blanqui\\'s description in 1837 of la révolution industrielle. friedrich engels in the condition of the working class in england in 1844 spoke of \"an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society\".  however, although engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into english until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. credit for popularising the term may be given to arnold toynbee, whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.economic historians and authors such as mendels, pomeranz and kridte argue that the proto-industrialization in parts of europe, islamic world, mughal india, and china created the social and economic conditions that led to the industrial revolution, thus emerging the great divergence.some historians, such as john clapham and nicholas crafts, have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer. this is still a subject of debate among some historians.\\n\\n\\n== important technological developments ==\\nthe commencement of the industrial revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations, beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  by the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:\\n\\ntextiles – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. the power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.  the cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.  large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.\\nsteam power – the efficiency of steam engines increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel.  the adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.  the high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.  steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.\\niron making – the substitution of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of pig iron and wrought iron production.  using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces, resulting in economies of scale.  the steam engine began being used to pump water and to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power.  the cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760.  it was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures.  the puddling process produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the finery forge.  the rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. hot blast (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.\\ninvention of machine tools – the first machine tools were invented.  these included the screw cutting lathe, cylinder boring machine and the milling machine.  machine tools made the economical manufacture of precision metal parts possible, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.\\n\\n\\n=== textile manufacture ===\\n\\n\\n==== british textile industry statistics ====\\n\\nin 1750 britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in lancashire. the work was done by hand in workers\\' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. in 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines. the british textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850.the share of value added by the cotton textile industry in britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831.  value added by the british woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  cotton factories in britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  in 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  in 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  in 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in britain.  in 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.wages in lancashire, a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in india in 1770, when overall productivity in britain was about three times higher than in india.\\n\\n\\n==== cotton ====\\nparts of india, china, central america, south america and the middle-east have a long history of hand manufacturing cotton textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 ad. in tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  in the 15th century china began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. by the 17th century almost all chinese wore cotton clothing.  almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a medium of exchange.  in india a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. india produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.cotton was a difficult raw material for europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the americas.  the early spanish explorers found native americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (gossypium barbadense) and upland green seeded cotton gossypium hirsutum.  sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of georgia and south carolina, but did poorly inland.  sea island cotton began being exported from barbados in the 1650s. upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern u.s., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the cotton gin. a strain of cotton seed brought from mexico to natchez, mississippi in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick.\\n\\n\\n==== trade and textiles ====\\n\\nthe age of discovery was followed by a period of colonialism beginning around the 16th century. following the discovery of a trade route to india around southern africa by the portuguese, the dutch established the verenigde oostindische compagnie (abbr. voc) or dutch east india company, the world\\'s first transnational corporation and  the first multinational enterprise to issue shares of stock to the public. the british later founded the east india company, along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the indian ocean region and between the indian ocean region and north atlantic europe.  one of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in india and sold in southeast asia, including the indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to southeast asia and europe.  by the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the east india company\\'s exports.  indian textiles were in demand in north atlantic region of europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in western europe was minor until the early 19th century.\\n\\n\\n==== pre-mechanized european textile production ====\\n\\nby 1600 flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in english towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the guilds who did not consider cotton a threat.  earlier european attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th-century italy and 15th-century southern germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  the moors in spain grew, spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century.british cloth could not compete with indian cloth because india\\'s labour cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of britain\\'s. in 1700 and 1721 the british government passed calico acts in order to protect the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from india.the demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around lancashire that produced fustian, a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft.  flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.on the eve of the industrial revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the putting-out system.  occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  in the off season the women, typically farmers\\' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  using the spinning wheel, it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.\\n\\n\\n==== invention of textile machinery ====\\nthe flying shuttle, patented in 1733 by john kay, with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  it became widely used around lancashire after 1760 when john\\'s son, robert, invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.lewis paul patented the roller spinning frame and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. the technology was developed with the help of john wyatt of birmingham.  paul and wyatt opened a mill in birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. in 1743 a factory opened in northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of paul and wyatt\\'s machines. this operated until about 1764. a similar mill was built by daniel bourn in leominster, but this burnt down. both lewis paul and daniel bourn patented carding machines in 1748. based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. lewis\\'s invention was later developed and improved by richard arkwright in his water frame and samuel crompton in his spinning mule.\\n\\nin 1764 in the village of stanhill, lancashire, james hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which he patented in 1770. it was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.  the jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting. it was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792, and was used mainly by home spinners. the jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft, not warp.the spinning frame or water frame was developed by richard arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. the design was partly based on a spinning machine built for thomas high by clockmaker john kay, who was hired by arkwright.  for each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  the roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  the top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  the weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. the bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  the water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in britain.  a horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in cromford, derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.\\n\\nsamuel crompton\\'s spinning mule was introduced in 1779.  mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.  crompton\\'s mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.\\n\\nrealising that the expiration of the arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and led to a shortage of weavers, edmund cartwright developed a vertical power loom which he patented in 1785.  in 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.  cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. cartwright\\'s loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. samuel horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  horock\\'s loom was improved by richard roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by roberts, hill & co.the demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the southern united states, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. eli whitney responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive cotton gin.  a man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.these advances were capitalised on by entrepreneurs, of whom the best known is richard arkwright. he is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as thomas highs and john kay; arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. he created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power—first horse power and then water power—which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of yarn increased greatly. before long steam power was applied to drive textile machinery. manchester acquired the nickname cottonopolis during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in india, which allowed high thread counts.  however, the high productivity of british textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of british cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage india, eventually destroying the industry.\\n\\n\\n==== wool ====\\nthe earliest european attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  productivity improvement in wool spinning during the industrial revolution was significant but was far less than that of cotton.\\n\\n\\n==== silk ====\\n\\narguably the first highly mechanised factory was john lombe\\'s water-powered silk mill at derby, operational by 1721. lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. although lombe\\'s factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  in order to promote manufacturing the crown paid for models of lombe\\'s machinery which were exhibited in the tower of london.\\n\\n\\n=== iron industry ===\\n\\n\\n==== uk iron production statistics ====\\nbar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. a small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  cast iron was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  bar iron was also made by the bloomery process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.\\nin  the uk in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. in 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  in 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  in 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.in 1750 the uk imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  in 1796 the uk was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. in 1806 the uk did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.\\n\\n\\n==== iron process innovations ====\\na major change in the iron industries during the era of the industrial revolution was the replacement of wood and other bio-fuels with coal. for a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal, and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.  by 1750 coke had generally replaced charcoal in smelting of copper and lead, and was in widespread use in making glass.  in the smelting and refining of iron, coal and coke produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal\\'s sulfur content.  low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content. a minority of coals are coking.\\nanother factor limiting the iron industry before the industrial revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  this limitation was overcome by the steam engine.use of coal in iron smelting started somewhat before the industrial revolution, based on innovations by sir clement clerke and others from 1678, using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas. these were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture, reducing the oxide to metal. this has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. this technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687. it was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (the foundry cupola is a different, and later, innovation.)by 1709 abraham darby made progress using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at coalbrookdale. however, the coke pig iron he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. he had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.\\ncoke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron until 1755–56, when darby\\'s son abraham darby ii built furnaces at horsehay and ketley where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from coalbrookdale).  these new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by newcomen steam engines.  the newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  abraham darby iii installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the dale company when he took control in 1768.  the dale company used several newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. in 1757, iron master john wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine for blast furnaces. the blowing cylinder for blast furnaces was introduced in 1760 and the first blowing cylinder made of cast iron is believed to be the one used at carrington in 1768 that was designed by john smeaton.  cast iron cylinders for use with a piston were difficult to manufacture; the cylinders had to be free of holes and had to be machined smooth and straight to remove any warping.  james watt had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  in 1774 john wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. after wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a boulton and watt steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.  after watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.the solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag and the use of low sulfur coal.  use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. the increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.  in addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.as cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings.  a famous early example was the iron bridge built in 1778 with cast iron produced by abraham darby iii.  however, most cast iron was converted to wrought iron.\\neurope relied on the bloomery for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  conversion of cast iron was done in a finery forge, as it long had been.  an improved refining process known as potting and stamping was developed, but this was superseded by henry cort\\'s puddling process. cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: rolling in 1783 and puddling in 1784.  puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.\\npuddling was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  the decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  when the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  few puddlers lived to be 40.  because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  the puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. rolling was 15 times faster at this than a trip hammer.  a different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.\\nthe puddling process was improved in 1818 by baldwyn rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.  in 1838 john hall patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. the tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.  hall\\'s process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. hall\\'s process, called wet puddling, reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.puddling became widely used after 1800. up to that time british iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from sweden and russia to supplement domestic supplies.  because of the increased british production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.hot blast, patented by james beaumont neilson in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  by using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.  hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  this meant that lower quality coal or anthracite could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive; however, by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.\\nshortly before the industrial revolution an improvement was made in the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. benjamin huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s. the raw material for this was blister steel, made by the cementation process.the supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. the development of machine tools allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.\\n\\n\\n=== steam power ===\\n\\nthe development of the stationary steam engine was an important element of the industrial revolution; however, during the early period of the industrial revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  in britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  by 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000 hp.the first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to thomas savery in 1698. he constructed and patented in london a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one horsepower (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its \"brand name\", the miner\\'s friend). savery\\'s pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.the first successful piston steam engine was introduced by thomas newcomen before 1712. a number of newcomen engines were installed in britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of 5 hp (3.7 kw). they were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  they were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. despite their disadvantages, newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. by 1729, when newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to hungary in 1722, germany, austria, and sweden. a total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. in the 1770s the engineer john smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. a total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.\\n\\na fundamental change in working principles was brought about by scotsman james watt. with financial support from his business partner englishman matthew boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  the separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  these improvements increased engine efficiency so that boulton and watt\\'s engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as newcomen\\'s. boulton and watt opened the soho foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.by 1783 the watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double-acting rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. both of watt\\'s basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm boulton & watt had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving blast furnaces, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10 hp (3.7 to 7.5 kw).\\nuntil about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine, built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the table engine. around the start of the 19th century, at which time the boulton and watt patent expired, the cornish engineer richard trevithick and the american oliver evans began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. high pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats.the development of machine tools, such as the engine lathe, planing, milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread electrification in the early 20th century. these included crank-powered, treadle-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.\\n\\n\\n=== machine tools ===\\n\\npre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen—millwrights built water and windmills, carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  as the industrial revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. there was also the need for precision in making parts.  precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.\\nthe demand for metal parts led to the development of several machine tools. they have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.\\nbefore the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.the first large precision machine tool was the cylinder boring machine invented by john wilkinson in 1774. it used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. wilkinson\\'s boring machine differed from earlier cantilevered machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.the planing machine, the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.henry maudslay, who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the royal arsenal, woolwich. he worked as an apprentice in the royal gun foundry of jan verbruggen. in 1774 jan verbruggen had installed a horizontal boring machine in woolwich which was the first industrial size lathe in the uk. maudslay was hired away by joseph bramah for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.  the slide rest lathe was called one of history\\'s most important inventions.  although it was not entirely maudslay\\'s idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.maudslay left bramah\\'s employment and set up his own shop. he was engaged to build the machinery for making ships\\' pulley blocks for the royal navy in the portsmouth block mills. these machines were all-metal and were the first machines for mass production and making components with a degree of interchangeability. the lessons maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as richard roberts, joseph clement and joseph whitworth.james fox of derby had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did matthew murray of leeds. roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.\\nthe effect of machine tools during the industrial revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. the techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be interchangeable is largely attributed to a program of the u.s. department of war which perfected interchangeable parts for firearms in the early 19th century.in the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the machine industry became the largest industrial sector of the u.s. economy, by value added.\\n\\n\\n=== chemicals ===\\nthe large-scale production of chemicals was an important development during the industrial revolution. the first of these was the production of sulphuric acid by the lead chamber process invented by the englishman john roebuck (james watt\\'s first partner) in 1746. he was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of lead. instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around 100 pounds (50 kg) in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.\\nthe production of an alkali on a large scale became an important goal as well, and nicolas leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of sodium carbonate. the leblanc process was a reaction of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid. the sodium sulfate was heated with limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide. adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulfide. the process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulfide was a useless waste product). nonetheless, this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants (barilla) or from kelp, which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash, and also to potash (potassium carbonate) produced from hardwood ashes.\\nthese two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. early uses for sulfuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for bleaching cloth.\\nthe development of bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) by scottish chemist charles tennant in about 1800, based on the discoveries of french chemist claude louis berthollet, revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. tennant\\'s factory at st rollox, north glasgow, became the largest chemical plant in the world.\\nafter 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in dyestuffs, and germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry. aspiring chemists flocked to german universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. british scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire german-trained chemists.\\n\\n\\n=== cement ===\\n\\nin 1824 joseph aspdin, a british bricklayer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades. this process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1,400 °c (2,552 °f), then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and gravel to produce concrete. portland cement was used by the famous english engineer marc isambard brunel several years later when constructing the thames tunnel. cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the london sewerage system a generation later.\\n\\n\\n=== gas lighting ===\\n\\nanother major industry of the later industrial revolution was gas lighting. though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of william murdoch, an employee of boulton & watt, the birmingham steam engine pioneers. the process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. the first gas lighting utilities were established in london between 1812 and 1820. they soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the uk. gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.\\n\\n\\n=== glass making ===\\n\\na new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in europe during the early 19th century. in 1832 this process was used by the chance brothers to create sheet glass. they became the leading producers of window and plate glass. this advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. the crystal palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.\\n\\n\\n=== paper machine ===\\n\\na machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by nicholas louis robert who worked for saint-léger didot family in france. the paper machine is known as a fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers sealy and henry fourdrinier, who were stationers in london. although greatly improved and with many variations, the fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.\\nthe method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other continuous production processes.\\n\\n\\n=== agriculture ===\\n\\nthe british agricultural revolution is considered one of the causes of the industrial revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy.  however, per-capita food supply in europe was stagnant or declining and did not improve in some parts of europe until the late 18th century.industrial technologies that affected farming included the seed drill, the dutch plough, which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.\\nthe english lawyer jethro tull invented an improved seed drill in 1701. it was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  this was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  tull\\'s seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an effect. good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.joseph foljambe\\'s rotherham plough of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough.  the threshing machine, invented by the scottish engineer andrew meikle in 1784, displaced hand threshing with a flail, a laborious job that took about one-quarter of agricultural labour.  it took several decades to diffuse and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the swing riots.\\nmachine tools and metalworking techniques developed during the industrial revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.\\n\\n\\n=== mining ===\\ncoal mining in britain, particularly in south wales, started early. before the steam engine, pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. in other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill. shaft mining was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. it could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). in either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. the introduction of the steam pump by thomas savery in 1698 and the newcomen steam engine in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. these were developments that had begun before the industrial revolution, but the adoption of john smeaton\\'s improvements to the newcomen engine followed by james watt\\'s more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  the cornish engine, developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the watt steam engine.\\ncoal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of firedamp in many coal seams. some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in 1816 by sir humphry davy and independently by george stephenson. however, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. firedamp explosions continued, often setting off coal dust explosions, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.\\n\\n\\n=== transportation ===\\n\\nat the beginning of the industrial revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. wagonways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  the first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.the industrial revolution improved britain\\'s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.\\n\\n\\n==== canals and improved waterways ====\\n\\nbefore and during the industrial revolution navigation on several british rivers was improved by removing obstructions, straightening curves, widening and deepening and building navigation locks.  britain had over 1,000 miles of navigable rivers and streams by 1750.canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  this was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.in the uk, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  known for its huge commercial success, the bridgewater canal in north west england, which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by the 3rd duke of bridgewater.  from worsley to the rapidly growing town of manchester its construction cost £168,000 (£22,589,130 as of 2013), but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in manchester fell by about half. this success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as canal mania. new canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the bridgewater canal, the most notable being the leeds and liverpool canal and the thames and severn canal which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.\\nby the 1820s a national network was in existence. canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. they were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. the last major canal to be built in the united kingdom was the manchester ship canal, which upon opening in 1894 was the largest ship canal in the world, and opened manchester as a port. however it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.\\nbritain\\'s canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early industrial revolution to be seen in britain.\\n\\n\\n==== roads ====\\n\\nfrance was known for having an excellent system of roads at the time of the industrial revolution; however, most of the roads on the european continent and in the u.k. were in bad condition and dangerously rutted.much of the original british road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in england and wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust. new engineered roads were built by john metcalf, thomas telford and most notably john mcadam, with the first \\'macadamised\\' stretch of road being marsh road at ashton gate, bristol in 1816. the major turnpikes radiated from london and were the means by which the royal mail was able to reach the rest of the country. heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of pack horse. stagecoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts.\\n\\n\\n==== railways ====\\n\\nreducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. this was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at croydon, england.\\n\\n“a good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  a party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  a horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”\\nrailways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive puddled iron after 1800, the rolling mill for making rails, and the development of the high-pressure steam engine also around 1800.\\nwagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. these were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. the first applications of the steam locomotive were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. see: metallurgy\\nsteam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the boulton and watt patent in 1800. high-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  they were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  a few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  steam-hauled public railways began with the stockton and darlington railway in 1825.\\nthe rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 rainhill trials, which demonstrated robert stephenson\\'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of hot blast, which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the blast furnace.\\non 15 september 1830, the liverpool and manchester railway was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by prime minister, the duke of wellington. the railway was engineered by joseph locke and george stephenson, linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of manchester with the port town of liverpool. the opening was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. the success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to railway mania.\\nconstruction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first industrial revolution. after many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.\\n\\n\\n=== other developments ===\\nother developments included more efficient water wheels, based on experiments conducted by the british engineer john smeaton the beginnings of a machine industry and the rediscovery of concrete (based on hydraulic lime mortar) by john smeaton, which had been lost for 1,300 years.\\n\\n\\n== social effects ==\\n\\n\\n=== factory system ===\\n\\nprior to the industrial revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. it was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  households also spun and wove for market production.  at the beginning of the industrial revolution india, china and regions of iraq and elsewhere in asia and the middle east produced most of the world\\'s cotton cloth while europeans produced wool and linen goods.\\nin britain by the 16th century the putting-out system, by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as cottage industry, was being practiced.  typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  merchant capitalists typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the piece, and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  the logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a 40 spindle jenny for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.  later machinery such as spinning frames, spinning mules and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.\\nthe majority of textile factory workers during the industrial revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  they typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only sundays off.  it was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers. many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (see: british agricultural revolution, threshing machine)\\nthe change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by karl marx, however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.\\n\\n\\n=== standards of living ===\\nsome economists, such as robert e. lucas, jr., say that the real effect of the industrial revolution was that \"for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth ... nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility.\" others, however, argue that while growth of the economy\\'s overall productive powers was unprecedented during the industrial revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers\\' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s. similarly, the average height of the population declined during the industrial revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. real wages were not keeping up with the price of food.during the industrial revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. the percentage of the children born in london who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.the effects on living conditions of the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s. a series of 1950s essays by henry phelps brown and sheila v. hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards. during 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.\\n\\n\\n==== food and nutrition ====\\n\\nchronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including britain and france, until the late 19th century. until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in france was about 35 years and about 40 years in britain. the united states population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years although u.s. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century. food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the antebellum puzzle.food supply in great britain was adversely affected by the corn laws (1815–1846).  the corn laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  the corn laws were repealed in the early years of the great irish famine.\\nthe initial technologies of the industrial revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices. in britain and the netherlands, food supply increased before the industrial revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by thomas malthus.  this condition is called the malthusian trap, and it finally started to overcome by transportation improvements, such as canals, improved roads and steamships.  railroads and steamships were introduced near the end of the industrial revolution.\\n\\n\\n==== housing ====\\nthe rapid population growth in the 19th century included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as edinburgh and london. the critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with  large contracting firms.  private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. p. kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.  people moved in so rapidly there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. cholera from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as the one that devastated ireland in the 1840s.a large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. by far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the socialist movement, the condition of the working class in england in 1844 friedrich engels described backstreet sections of manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  these shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  there were no sanitary facilities. population density was extremely high. however, not everyone lived in such poor conditions. the industrial revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.\\nconditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. in the introduction of his 1892 edition, engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. for example, the public health act 1875 led to the more sanitary byelaw terraced house.\\n\\n\\n==== sanitation ====\\nin the condition of the working class in england in 1844 friedrich engels described how untreated sewage created awful odours and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.\\nin 1854 john snow traced a cholera outbreak in soho in london to faecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  snow\\'s findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.\\n\\n\\n==== water supply ====\\npre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  pipes were typically made of wood.  steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.\\n\\n\\n==== increase in literacy ====\\nthe invention of the paper machine and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.\\n\\n\\n=== clothing and consumer goods ===\\n\\nconsumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in europe.  watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in britain, potter and entrepreneur josiah wedgwood, founder of wedgwood fine china and porcelain, created goods such as tableware, which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.a growing consumer culture also saw people start to spend more money on entertainment. increased literacy rates, industrialisation, and the invention of railway, created a new market for cheap popular literature for the masses and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. penny dreadfuls were created in the 1830s to meet this demand. the guardian described penny dreadfuls as “britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young”, and “the victorian equivalent of video games”. more than one million boys’ periodicals were sold per week.in 1861, welsh entrepreneur pryce pryce-jones formed the first mail order business, an idea which would change the nature of retail. selling welsh flannel, he created mail order catalogues, with customers able to order by mail for the first time—this following the uniform penny post in 1840 and the invention of the postage stamp (penny black) where there was a charge of one penny for carriage and delivery between any two places in the united kingdom irrespective of distance—and the goods were delivered throughout the uk via the newly created railway system. as the railway network expanded overseas, so did his business.\\n\\n\\n=== population increase ===\\nthe industrial revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.according to robert hughes in the fatal shore, the population of england and wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. the population of england had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.  improved conditions led to the population of britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s. europe\\'s population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.\\n\\n\\n=== urbanization ===\\n\\nthe growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive urbanisation and the rise of new great cities, first in europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  in 1800, only 3% of the world\\'s population lived in cities, compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century). manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.\\n\\n\\n=== effect on women and family life ===\\nwomen\\'s historians have debated the effect of the industrial revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women. taking a pessimistic side, alice clark argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th-century england, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. clark argues that in 16th-century england, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. the home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. however, clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.in a more positive interpretation, ivy pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for women\\'s emancipation.  tilly and scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in english history. in the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. the second stage was the \"family wage economy\" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. the third or modern stage is the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.ideas of thrift and hard work characterized middle-class families as the industrial revolution swept europe. these values were displayed in samuel smiles\\' book self-help, in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was \"voluntary and self-imposed – the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct.\"\\n\\n\\n=== labour conditions ===\\n\\n\\n==== social structure and working conditions ====\\nin terms of social structure, the industrial revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. as late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the united states still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life; however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.  for workers of the labouring classes, industrial life \"was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts.\" also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place. pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel – child labour, dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the industrial revolution.\\n\\n\\n==== factories and urbanisation ====\\n\\nindustrialisation led to the creation of the factory. the factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of manchester, nicknamed \"cottonopolis\", and the world\\'s first industrial city. manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of bradford was actually born there.in addition, between 1815 and 1939, 20 percent of europe\\'s population left home, pushed by poverty, a rapidly growing population, and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing. they were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labour overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to europe. this mass migration had large demographic effects: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent. the americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the united states.\\nfor much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically water-powered and built to serve local needs. later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.\\nin other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. one of the earliest such reformers was robert owen, known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the new lanark mills, and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the early socialist movement.\\nby 1746 an integrated brass mill was working at warmley near bristol. raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. housing was provided for workers on site. josiah wedgwood and matthew boulton (whose soho manufactory was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.\\n\\n\\n==== child labour ====\\n\\nthe industrial revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the industrial revolution, although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly. there was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. this made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. in england and scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children.child labour existed before the industrial revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders, 10–20% of an adult male\\'s wage.reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines and textile factories, and these helped to popularise the children\\'s plight. the public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers\\' welfare.\\npoliticians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation, and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. in 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the factory acts, were passed in britain: children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult. about ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in europe and the united states until the 20th century.\\n\\n\\n==== organisation of labour ====\\n\\nthe industrial revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people. the power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.\\nthe main method the unions used to effect change was strike action. many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. in britain, the combination act 1799 forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. even after this, unions were still severely restricted. one british newspaper in 1834 described unions as \"the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country...\"in 1832, the reform act extended the vote in britain but did not grant universal suffrage. that year six men from tolpuddle in dorset founded the friendly society of agricultural labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. they refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. in 1834 james frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the prime minister, lord melbourne, to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the friendly society had done. james brine, james hammett, george loveless, george\\'s brother james loveless, george\\'s brother in-law thomas standfield, and thomas\\'s son john standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to australia. they became known as the tolpuddle martyrs. in the 1830s and 1840s, the chartist movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. its charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by parliament without consideration.\\nworking people also formed friendly societies and co-operative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. enlightened industrialists, such as robert owen also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.\\nunions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. in 1842, a general strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the chartist movement which stopped production across great britain.eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the british labour party.\\n\\n\\n==== luddites ====\\n\\nthe rapid industrialisation of the english economy cost many craft workers their jobs. the movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. these attackers became known as luddites, supposedly followers of ned ludd, a folklore figure. the first attacks of the luddite movement began in 1811. the luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the british government took drastic measures, using the militia or army to protect industry. those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or transported for life.\\nunrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern britain were affected by the captain swing disturbances. threshing machines were a particular target, and hayrick burning was a popular activity. however, the riots led to the first formation of trade unions, and further pressure for reform.\\n\\n\\n==== shift in production\\'s center of gravity ====\\nthe traditional centers of hand textile production such as india, parts of the middle east and later china could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.the industrial revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.\\n\\n\\n==== effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery ====\\ncheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. some cotton had been grown in the west indies, particularly in hispaniola, but haitian cotton production was halted by the haitian revolution in 1791. the invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton plantations in the united states and brazil. in 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with u.s. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  by 1800, u.s. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  in 1945 the u.s. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.the americas, particularly the u.s., had labour shortages and high priced labour, which made slavery attractive.  america\\'s cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.  the u.s. civil war created a \"cotton famine\" that led to increased production in other areas of the world, including new colonies in africa.\\n\\n\\n=== effect on environment ===\\n\\nthe origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the industrial revolution. the emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. the first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of britain\\'s alkali acts, passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution (gaseous hydrochloric acid) given off by the leblanc process, used to produce soda ash. an alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. the responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the alkali order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted smoke, grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\\nthe manufactured gas industry began in british cities in 1812–1820. the technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. the gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. they usually lost and modified the worst practices. the city of london repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the thames and poisoning its fish. finally, parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.  the industry reached the us around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.in industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms. typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. the coal smoke abatement society was formed in britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental ngos. it was founded by artist sir william blake richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the public health act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. it also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. the provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the smoke abatement act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.\\n\\n\\n=== nations and nationalism ===\\nin his 1983 book nations and nationalism, philosopher ernest gellner argues that the industrial revolution and economic modernization spurred the creation of nations.\\n\\n\\n== industrialisation beyond the united kingdom ==\\n\\n\\n=== continental europe ===\\nthe industrial revolution on continental europe came a little later than in great britain. in many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in britain in new places. often the technology was purchased from britain or british engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. by 1809, part of the ruhr valley in westphalia was called \\'miniature england\\' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of england. the german, russian and belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. in some cases (such as iron), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the british technology were adopted.\\n\\n\\n==== belgium ====\\nbelgium was the second country, after britain, in which the industrial revolution took place and the first in continental europe: wallonia (french-speaking southern belgium) was the first region to follow the british model successfully. starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around liège and charleroi. the leader was a transplanted englishman john cockerill. his factories at seraing integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. thanks to coal (the french word \"houille\" was coined in wallonia), the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after britain. but it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its sillon industriel, \\'especially in the haine, sambre and meuse valleys, between the borinage and liège, [...] there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...\\'. philippe raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: \"it was not propaganda but a reality the walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after britain.\" \"the sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of walloon was the old cloth-making town of ghent.\" michel de coster, professor at the université de liège wrote also: \"the historians and the economists say that belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory [...] but this rank is the one of wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated.\" \\n\\n\\n===== demographic effects =====\\nwallonia was also the birthplace of a strong socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. at the left, the sillon industriel, which runs from mons in the west, to verviers in the east (except part of north flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). even if belgium is the second industrial country after britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. in \\'breaking stereotypes\\', muriel neven and isabelle devious say:\\n\\nthe industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern belgium. during the middle ages and the early modern period, flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres [...] at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. by comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most west european countries, 16 per cent in france and 25 per cent in britain. nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in ghent [...] also, in wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. especially in the haine, sambre and meuse valleys, between the borinage and liège, where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. during these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the walloon population in this region. nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.\\n\\n\\n==== france ====\\nthe industrial revolution in france followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. notably, most french historians argue france did not go through a clear take-off. instead, france\\'s economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. however, some stages were identified by maurice lévy-leboyer:\\nfrench revolution and napoleonic wars (1789–1815),\\nindustrialisation, along with britain (1815–1860),\\neconomic slowdown (1860–1905),\\nrenewal of the growth after 1905.\\n\\n\\n==== germany ====\\n\\nbased on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world\\'s chemical industry in the late 19th century. at first the production of dyes based on aniline was critical.germany\\'s political disunity—with three dozen states—and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. however, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each german state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. lacking a technological base at first, the germans imported their engineering and hardware from britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. in many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to britain\\'s. however, german unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. unlike the situation in france, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of hamburg and bremen. by 1880, germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of france.\\n\\n\\n==== sweden ====\\n\\nduring the period 1790–1815 sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a protoindustrialisation, with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. this led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s. between 1815 and 1850, the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. this period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in bergslagen, textile mills in sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in norrland. several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced in 1842 (as the first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.\\nfrom 1850 to 1890, sweden experienced its “first” industrial revolution with a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873. large infrastructural investments were made during this period, mainly in the expanding rail road network, which was financed in part by the government and in part by private enterprises. from 1890 to 1930, new industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, papermaking and textile.\\n\\n\\n=== japan ===\\n\\nthe industrial revolution began about 1870 as meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the west. the government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. it inaugurated a new western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the united states and europe, and hired more than 3,000 westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in japan (foreign government advisors in meiji japan).\\nin 1871, a group of japanese politicians known as the iwakura mission toured europe and the united states to learn western ways. the result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable japan to quickly catch up. the bank of japan, founded in 1882, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. education was expanded and japanese students were sent to study in the west.\\nmodern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.\\n\\n\\n=== united states ===\\n\\nduring the late 18th an early 19th centuries when the uk and parts of western europe began to industrialise, the us was primarily an agricultural and natural resource producing and processing economy.  the building of roads and canals, the introduction of steamboats and the building of railroads were important for handling agricultural and natural resource products in the large and sparsely populated country of the period.important american technological contributions during the period of the industrial revolution were the cotton gin and the development of a system for making interchangeable parts, the latter aided by the development of the milling machine in the us.  the development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the us as the world\\'s leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.\\noliver evans invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used control mechanisms and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  this is considered to be the first modern materials handling system an important advance in the progress toward mass production.the united states originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. as a result, industrialisation was concentrated in new england and the northeastern united states, which has fast-moving rivers. the newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. in the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the midwest.\\nthomas somers and the cabot brothers founded the beverly cotton manufactory in 1787, the first cotton mill in america, the largest cotton mill of its era, and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. this mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. despite the losses, the manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in slater\\'s mill.in 1793, samuel slater (1768–1835) founded the slater mill at pawtucket, rhode island. he had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in derbyshire, england, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for new york in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. after founding slater\\'s mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills. daniel day established a wool carding mill in the blackstone valley at uxbridge, massachusetts in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the us (the first was in hartford, connecticut, and the second at watertown, massachusetts.) the john h. chafee blackstone river valley national heritage corridor retraces the history of \"america\\'s hardest-working river\\', the blackstone. the blackstone river and its tributaries, which cover more than 45 miles (72 km) from worcester, massachusetts to providence, rhode island, was the birthplace of america\\'s industrial revolution. at its peak over 1,100 mills operated in this valley, including slater\\'s mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of america\\'s industrial and technological development.\\nmerchant francis cabot lowell from newburyport, massachusetts memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of british factories in 1810. realising that the war of 1812 had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in america, on his return to the united states, he set up the boston manufacturing company. lowell and his partners built america\\'s second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at waltham, massachusetts, second to the beverly cotton manufactory. after his death in 1817, his associates built america\\'s first planned factory town, which they named after him. this enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering, one of the first uses of it in the united states. lowell, massachusetts, using 5.6 miles (9.0 km) of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the merrimack river, is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the american industrial revolution. the short-lived utopia-like waltham-lowell system was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in britain. however, by 1850, especially following the irish potato famine, the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.\\na major u.s. contribution to industrialisation was the development of techniques to make interchangeable parts from metal.  precision metal machining techniques were developed by the u.s. department of war to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  the development work took place at the federal arsenals at springfield armory and harpers ferry armory.  techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  the milling machine, a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by eli whitney, who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  another important invention was the blanchard lathe, invented by thomas blanchard.  the blanchard lathe, or pattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks.  the use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardised and interchangeable parts became known as the american system of manufacturing.precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanised the shoe industry. and the watch industry. the industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in waltham, massachusetts, at the waltham watch company, with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.\\n\\n\\n== second industrial revolution ==\\n\\nsteel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a \"second industrial revolution\", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s, when sir henry bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities. however, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.  bessemer steel was being displaced by the open hearth furnace near the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nthis second industrial revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the chemical industries, petroleum (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the automotive industry, and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from britain to the united states and germany.\\nthe increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.\\na new revolution began with electricity and electrification in the electrical industries. the introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the alps enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern italy, beginning in the 1890s.\\nby the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like u.s. steel, general electric, standard oil and bayer ag joined the railroad and ship companies on the world\\'s stock markets.\\n\\n\\n== causes ==\\n\\nthe causes of the industrial revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate.  geographic factors include britain\\'s vast mineral resources.  in addition to metal ores, britain had the highest quality coal reserves known at the time.  britain also had abundant water power and highly productive agriculture.  britain also had numerous seaports and navigable waterways.some historians believe the industrial revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in britain after the english civil war in the 17th century, although feudalism began to break down after the black death of the mid 14th century, followed by other epidemics, until the population reached a low in the 14th century. this created labour shortages and led to falling food prices and a peak in real wages around 1500, after which population growth began reducing wages. inflation caused by coinage debasement after 1540 followed by precious metals supply increasing from the americas caused land rents (often long term leases that transferred to heirs on death) to fall in real terms.the enclosure movement and the british agricultural revolution made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into cottage industry, for example weaving, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories. the colonial expansion of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors, as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century.  a change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine. however, recent research into the marketing era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the industrial revolution.lewis mumford has proposed that the industrial revolution had its origins in the early middle ages, much earlier than most estimates. he explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that \"the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock\". he also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.\\nthe presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the industrial revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in britain. in other nations, such as france, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them. internal tariffs were abolished by henry viii of england, they survived in russia until 1753, 1789 in france and 1839 in spain.\\ngovernments\\' grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system (the statute of monopolies in 1623) is considered an influential factor. the effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. in return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as james watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. however, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors. watt\\'s monopoly prevented other inventors, such as richard trevithick, william murdoch,  or jonathan hornblower, whom boulton and watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.\\n\\n\\n=== causes in europe ===\\n\\none question of active interest to historians is why the industrial revolution occurred in europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly china, india, and the middle east (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100), or at other times like in classical antiquity or the middle ages. a recent account argued that europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early indo-european invaders. many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. in fact, before the industrial revolution, \"there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy.\" these historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes (see scientific revolution in europe), \"modern\" government, \"modern\" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.china was the world\\'s most technologically advanced country for many centuries; however, china stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by western europe before the age of discovery, by which time china banned imports and denied entry to foreigners. china was also a totalitarian society.  china also heavily taxed transported goods. modern estimates of per capita income in western europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in purchasing power parity (and britain had a per capita income of nearly 2,000 dollars) whereas china, by comparison, had only 450 dollars.  india was essentially feudal, politically fragmented and not as economically advanced as western europe.historians such as david landes and sociologist max weber and rodney stark credit the different belief systems in asia and europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.  the religion and beliefs of europe were largely products of judaeo-christianity and greek thought. conversely, chinese society was founded on men like confucius, mencius, han feizi (legalism), lao tzu (taoism), and buddha (buddhism), resulting in very different worldviews. other factors include the considerable distance of china\\'s coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable yellow river that connects these deposits to the sea.regarding india, the marxist historian rajani palme dutt said: \"the capital to finance the industrial revolution in india instead went into financing the industrial revolution in britain.\" in contrast to china, india was split up into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the mughal empire, with the major ones in its aftermath including the marathas, sikhs, bengal subah, and kingdom of mysore. in addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors—agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. it is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by monarchs prior to the british take over.economic historian joel mokyr argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of european states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. this is what set europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as china and india by providing \"an insurance against economic and technological stagnation\". china had both a printing press and movable type, and india had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as europe in 1700, yet the industrial revolution would occur in europe, not china or india. in europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an \"integrated market for ideas\" where europe\\'s intellectuals used the lingua franca of latin, had a shared intellectual basis in europe\\'s classical heritage and the pan-european institution of the republic of letters.in addition, europe\\'s monarchs desperately needed revenue, pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes. small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and tax-collecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state. located in a region \"at the hub of the largest and most varied network of exchange in history,\" europe advanced as the leader of the industrial revolution. in the americas, europeans found a windfall of silver, timber, fish, and maize, leading historian peter stearns to conclude that \"europe\\'s industrial revolution stemmed in great part from europe\\'s ability to draw disproportionately on world resources.\"modern capitalism originated in the italian city-states around the end of the first millennium.  the city-states were prosperous cities that were independent from feudal lords. they were largely republics whose governments were typically composed of merchants, manufacturers, members of guilds, bankers and financiers.  the italian city-states built a network of branch banks in leading western european cities and introduced double entry bookkeeping.  italian commerce was supported by schools that taught numeracy in financial calculations through abacus schools.\\n\\n\\n=== causes in britain ===\\n\\ngreat britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution.  key factors fostering this environment were:\\n\\nthe period of peace and stability which followed the unification of england and scotland\\nthere were no internal trade barriers, including between england and scotland, or feudal tolls and tariffs, making britain the \"largest coherent market in europe\"\\nthe rule of law (enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts)\\na straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations)\\nfree market (capitalism)\\ngeographical and natural resource advantages of great britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and britain had the highest quality coal in europe.  britain also had a large number of sites for water power.\\nthere were two main values that really drove the industrial revolution in britain. these values were self-interest and an entrepreneurial spirit. because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a consumer revolution. these advancements also greatly benefitted the british society as a whole. countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in britain and use them as an example to begin their own industrial revolutions.the debate about the start of the industrial revolution also concerns the massive lead that great britain had over other countries. some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the british slave trade between africa and the caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. however, it has been pointed out that slave trade and west indian plantations provided only 5% of the british national income during the years of the industrial revolution. even though slavery accounted for so little, caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of britain\\'s industrial output.\\n\\ninstead, the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly china and russia. britain emerged from the napoleonic wars as the only european nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (european merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the royal navy). britain\\'s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. the conflict resulted in most british warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of europe. this was further aided by britain\\'s geographical position—an island separated from the rest of mainland europe.\\n\\nanother theory is that britain was able to succeed in the industrial revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. it had a dense population for its small geographical size. enclosure of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. there was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the north of england, the english midlands, south wales and the scottish lowlands. local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the north west of england provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.\\nthe stable political situation in britain from around 1688 following the glorious revolution, and british society\\'s greater receptiveness to change (compared with other european countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the industrial revolution. peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism. (this point is also made in hilaire belloc\\'s the servile state.)\\nthe french philosopher voltaire wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on english society, letters on the english (1733), noting why england at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country\\'s less religiously tolerant european neighbours. \"take a view of the royal exchange in london, a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. there the jew, the mahometan [muslim], and the christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. there the presbyterian confides in the anabaptist, and the churchman depends on the quaker\\'s word. if one religion only were allowed in england, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another\\'s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.\"britain\\'s population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of western europe grew 50–80%. seventy percent of european urbanisation happened in britain 1750–1800. by 1800, only the netherlands was more urbanised than britain. this was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. the latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse\\'s work was mechanised. a workhorse needs 3 to 5 acres (1.21 to 2.02 ha) for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.\\nin 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in britain, while the netherlands had none; so despite having europe\\'s best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. in the 18th century, it was the only european country whose cities and population shrank. without coal, britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.  based on science and experimentation from the continent, the steam engine was developed specifically for pumping water out of mines, many of which in britain had been mined to below the water table. although extremely inefficient they were economical because they used unsaleable coal. iron rails were developed to transport coal, which was a major economic sector in britain.\\neconomic historian robert allen has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur. these factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in britain than other societies. however, two 2018 studies in the economic history review showed that wages were not particularly high in the british spinning sector or the construction sector, casting doubt on allen\\'s explanation.\\n\\n\\n=== transfer of knowledge ===\\n\\nknowledge of innovation was spread by several means. workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. a common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. during the whole of the industrial revolution and for the century before, all european countries and america engaged in study-touring; some nations, like sweden and france, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. in other countries, notably britain and america, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.\\nanother means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the lunar society of birmingham, in which members met to discuss \\'natural philosophy\\' (i.e. science) and often its application to manufacturing. the lunar society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, \"they were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the industrial revolution\". other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. for example, the london-based royal society of arts published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual transactions.\\nthere were publications describing technology. encyclopaedias such as harris\\'s lexicon technicum (1704) and abraham rees\\'s cyclopaedia (1802–1819) contain much of value. cyclopaedia contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the industrial revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. foreign printed sources such as the descriptions des arts et métiers and diderot\\'s encyclopédie explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.\\nperiodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. foreign periodicals, such as the annales des mines, published accounts of travels made by french engineers who observed british methods on study tours.\\n\\n\\n==== protestant work ethic ====\\n\\nanother theory is that the british advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work. the existence of this class is often linked to the protestant work ethic (see max weber) and the particular status of the baptists and the dissenting protestant sects, such as the quakers and presbyterians that had flourished with the english civil war. reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in britain in the glorious revolution of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the bank of england, contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.\\ndissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at england\\'s only two universities at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at scotland\\'s four universities). when the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official anglican church became mandatory due to the test act, they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. the unitarians, in particular, were very involved in education, by running dissenting academies, where, in contrast to the universities of oxford and cambridge and schools such as eton and harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.\\nhistorians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. while members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the middle class, such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.\\n\\n\\n== opposition from romanticism ==\\n\\nduring the industrial revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the romantic movement.  romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.  its major exponents in english included the artist and poet william blake and poets william wordsworth, samuel taylor coleridge, john keats, lord byron and percy bysshe shelley. the movement stressed the importance of \"nature\" in art and language, in contrast to \"monstrous\" machines and factories; the \"dark satanic mills\" of blake\\'s poem \"and did those feet in ancient time\". mary shelley\\'s novel frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. french romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\n\\n== footnotes ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\n\\n\\n=== sources ===\\n\\n\\n== external links ==\\nindustrial revolution at curlie\\ninternet modern history sourcebook: industrial revolution\\nbbc history home page: industrial revolution\\nnational museum of science and industry website: machines and personalities\\nfactory workers in the industrial revolution\\nthe industrial revolution – articles, video, pictures, and facts\\n\"the day the world took off\" six-part video series from the university of cambridge tracing the question \"why did the industrial revolution begin when and where it did.\"'],\n",
              "       ['human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected as natural and legal rights in municipal and international law. they are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights \"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being\" and which are \"inherent in all human beings\", regardless of their age, ethnic origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status. they are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. they are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.the doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law and global and regional institutions. actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide. the idea of human rights suggests that \"if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights\". the strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. the precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, free speech or a right to education, there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard.many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the second world war and the events of the holocaust, culminating in the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights in paris by the united nations general assembly in 1948. ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. the true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the european enlightenment with such philosophers as john locke, francis hutcheson and jean-jacques burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the american revolution and the french revolution. from this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society.\\n\\n\\n== history ==\\n\\nancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. the true forerunner of human-rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the european enlightenment. from this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century.17th-century english philosopher john locke discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being \"life, liberty, and estate (property)\", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract. in britain in 1689, the english bill of rights and the scottish claim of right each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions. two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the united states (1776) and in france (1789), leading to the united states declaration of independence and the french declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. additionally, the virginia declaration of rights of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms.\\n\\nwe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\n\\n=== 1800 to world war i ===\\n\\nphilosophers such as thomas paine, john stuart mill and hegel expanded on the theme of universality during the 18th and 19th centuries. in 1831 william lloyd garrison wrote in a newspaper called the liberator that he was trying to enlist his readers in \"the great cause of human rights\" so the term human rights probably came into use sometime between paine\\'s the rights of man and garrison\\'s publication. in 1849 a contemporary, henry david thoreau, wrote about human rights in his treatise on the duty of civil disobedience [2] which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers. united states supreme court justice david davis, in his 1867 opinion for ex parte milligan, wrote \"by the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people.\"many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. in western europe and north america, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour. the women\\'s rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote. national liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers. one of the most influential was mahatma gandhi\\'s movement to free his native india from british rule. movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the civil rights movement, and more recent diverse identity politics movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the united states.\\nthe foundation of the international committee of the red cross, the 1864 lieber code and the first of the geneva conventions in 1864 laid the foundations of international humanitarian law, to be further developed following the two world wars.\\n\\n\\n=== between world war i and world war ii ===\\nthe league of nations was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the treaty of versailles following the end of world war i. the league\\'s goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare. enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the universal declaration of human rights.\\nthe league of nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the western european colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state.\\nestablished as an agency of the league of nations, and now part of united nations, the international labour organization also had a mandate to promote and safeguard certain of the rights later included in the universal declaration of human rights (udhr):\\n\\nthe primary goal of the ilo today is to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.\\n\\n\\n=== after world war ii ===\\non the issue of \"universal\", the declarations did not apply to domestic discrimination or racism. henry j. richardson iii has argued:\\n\\nall major governments at the time of drafting the u.n. charter and the universal declaration did their best to ensure, by all means known to domestic and international law, that these principles had only international application and carried no legal obligation on those governments to be implemented domestically. all tacitly realized that for their own discriminated-against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide-reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite.\\n\\n\\n==== universal declaration of human rights ====\\n\\nthe universal declaration of human rights (udhr) is a non-binding declaration adopted by the united nations general assembly in 1948, partly in response to the barbarism of world war ii. the udhr urges member states to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the \"foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\". the declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the rights-duty duality.\\n\\n...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\\n\\nthe udhr was framed by members of the human rights commission, with eleanor roosevelt as chair, who began to discuss an international bill of rights in 1947. the members of the commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. the commission proceeded to frame the udhr and accompanying treaties, but the udhr quickly became the priority. canadian law professor john humprey and french lawyer rene cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. the document was structured by cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. the final three articles place, according to cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized. humphrey and cassin intended the rights in the udhr to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:\\nwhereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.\\n\\nsome of the udhr was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as mahatma gandhi. the inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. though this principle was not opposed by any member states at the time of adoption (the declaration was adopted unanimously, with the abstention of the soviet bloc, apartheid south africa and saudi arabia), this principle was later subject to significant challenges.the onset of the cold war soon after the udhr was conceived brought to the fore divisions over the inclusion of both economic and social rights and civil and political rights in the declaration. capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights (such as freedom of association and expression), and were reluctant to include economic and social rights (such as the right to work and the right to join a union). socialist states placed much greater importance on economic and social rights and argued strongly for their inclusion.because of the divisions over which rights to include, and because some states declined to ratify any treaties including certain specific interpretations of human rights, and despite the soviet bloc and a number of developing countries arguing strongly for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called unity resolution, the rights enshrined in the udhr were split into two separate covenants, allowing states to adopt some rights and derogate others. though this allowed the covenants to be created, it denied the proposed principle that all rights are linked which was central to some interpretations of the udhr.although the udhr is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered to be a central component of international customary law which may be invoked under appropriate circumstances by state judiciaries and other judiciaries.\\n\\n\\n==== human rights treaties ====\\nin 1966, the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) and the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights (icescr) were adopted by the united nations, between them making the rights contained in the udhr binding on all states. however, they came into force only in 1976, when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries (despite achieving the iccpr, a covenant including no economic or social rights, the us only ratified the iccpr in 1992). the icescr commits 155 state parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (escr) to individuals. \\n\\nsince then numerous other treaties (pieces of legislation) have been offered at the international level. they are generally known as human rights instruments. some of the most significant are:\\n\\nconvention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (adopted 1948, entry into force: 1951) [3]\\nconvention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination (cerd) (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969) [4]\\nconvention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (cedaw) (entry into force: 1981) [5]\\nunited nations convention against torture (cat) (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1984) [6]\\nconvention on the rights of the child (crc) (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989) convention on the rights of the child\\ninternational convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families (icrmw) (adopted 1990)\\nrome statute of the international criminal court (icc) (entry into force: 2002)\\n\\n\\n== international bodies ==\\n\\n\\n=== the united nations ===\\n\\nthe united nations (un) is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international jurisdiction for universal human rights legislation. all un organs have advisory roles to the united nations security council and the united nations human rights council, and there are numerous committees within the un with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties. the most senior body of the un with regard to human rights is the office of the high commissioner for human rights. the united nations has an international mandate to:\\n\\n...achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.\\n\\n\\n== protection in the international level ==\\n\\n\\n=== human rights council ===\\n\\nthe united nations human rights council, created at the 2005 world summit to replace the united nations commission on human rights, has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights. the human rights council is a subsidiary body of the general assembly and reports directly to it. it ranks below the security council, which is the final authority for the interpretation of the united nations charter. forty-seven of the one hundred ninety-one member states sit on the council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the united nations general assembly. members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. the council is based in geneva, and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.independent experts (rapporteurs) are retained by the council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to provide the council with reports.\\nthe human rights council may request that the security council refer cases to the international criminal court (icc) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the icc.\\n\\n\\n=== un treaty bodies ===\\n\\nin addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the un charter, the un has set up a number of treaty-based bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. they are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, with the exception of the cescr, which was established under a resolution of the economic and social council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties – rather than subsidiary to the united nations, though in practice they are closely intertwined with the united nations system and are supported by the un high commissioner for human rights (unhchr) and the un centre for human rights.\\nthe human rights committee promotes participation with the standards of the iccpr. the members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an optional protocol to the treaty. the judgments, termed \"views\", are not legally binding. the member of the committee meets around three times a year to hold sessions\\nthe committee on economic, social and cultural rights monitors the icescr and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance. it will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the optional protocol once it has come into force. it is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the economic and social council and ultimately to the general assembly. this means that the economic committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively \"weak\" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies. particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information.\\nthe committee on the elimination of racial discrimination monitors the cerd and conducts regular reviews of countries\\' performance. it can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding. it issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.\\nthe committee on the elimination of discrimination against women monitors the cedaw. it receives states\\' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 optional protocol.\\nthe committee against torture monitors the cat and receives states\\' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them. its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the optional protocol.\\nthe committee on the rights of the child monitors the crc and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. it does not have the power to receive complaints.\\nthe committee on migrant workers was established in 2004 and monitors the icrmw and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. it will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.\\nthe committee on the rights of persons with disabilities was established in 2008 to monitor the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. it has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.\\nthe committee on enforced disappearances monitors the icpped. all states parties are obliged to submit reports to the committee on how the rights are being implemented. the committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of \"concluding observations\".each treaty body receives secretariat support from the human rights council and treaties division of office of the high commissioner on human rights (ohchr) in geneva except cedaw, which is supported by the division for the advancement of women (daw). cedaw formerly held all its sessions at united nations headquarters in new york but now frequently meets at the united nations office in geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in geneva. the human rights committee usually holds its march session in new york city.\\n\\n\\n== regional human rights ==\\n\\nthere are many regional agreements and organizations promoting and governing human rights.\\n\\n\\n=== africa ===\\n\\nthe african union (au) is a supranational union consisting of fifty-five african states. established in 2001, the au\\'s purpose is to help secure africa\\'s democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, especially by bringing an end to intra-african conflict and creating an effective common market.the african commission on human and peoples\\' rights (achpr) is a quasi-judicial organ of the african union tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples\\') rights throughout the african continent as well as interpreting the african charter on human and peoples\\' rights and considering individual complaints of violations of the charter. the commission has three broad areas of responsibility:\\npromoting human and peoples\\' rights\\nprotecting human and peoples\\' rights\\ninterpreting the african charter on human and peoples\\' rightsin pursuit of these goals, the commission is mandated to \"collect documents, undertake studies and researches on african problems in the field of human and peoples, rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples\\' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments\" (charter, art. 45).with the creation of the african court on human and peoples\\' rights (under a protocol to the charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in january 2004), the commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the court\\'s jurisdiction. in a july 2004 decision, the au assembly resolved that the future court on human and peoples\\' rights would be integrated with the african court of justice.\\nthe court of justice of the african union is intended to be the \"principal judicial organ of the union\" (protocol of the court of justice of the african union, article 2.2). although it has not yet been established, it is intended to take over the duties of the african commission on human and peoples\\' rights, as well as act as the supreme court of the african union, interpreting all necessary laws and treaties. the protocol establishing the african court on human and peoples\\' rights entered into force in january 2004 but its merging with the court of justice has delayed its establishment. the protocol establishing the court of justice will come into force when ratified by 15 countries.there are many countries in africa accused of human rights violations by the international community and ngos.\\n\\n\\n=== americas ===\\nthe organization of american states (oas) is an international organization, headquartered in washington, d.c., united states. its members are the thirty-five independent states of the americas. over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the cold war, the return to democracy in latin america, and the thrust toward globalization, the oas made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. its stated priorities now include the following:\\nstrengthening democracy\\nworking for peace\\nprotecting human rights\\ncombating corruption\\nthe rights of indigenous peoples\\npromoting sustainable developmentthe inter-american commission on human rights (the iachr) is an autonomous organ of the organization of american states, also based in washington, d.c. along with the inter-american court of human rights, based in san josé, costa rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-american system for the promotion and protection of human rights. the iachr is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere. its human rights duties stem from three documents:\\nthe oas charter\\nthe american declaration of the rights and duties of man\\nthe american convention on human rightsthe inter-americal court of human rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the american convention on human rights. its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory. under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it. under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other oas bodies or member states.\\n\\n\\n=== asia ===\\n\\nthere are no asia-wide organisations or conventions to promote or protect human rights. countries vary widely in their approach to human rights and their record of human rights protection.\\nthe association of southeast asian nations (asean) is a geo-political and economic organization of 10 countries located in southeast asia, which was formed in 1967 by indonesia, malaysia, the philippines, singapore and thailand. the organisation now also includes brunei darussalam, vietnam, laos, myanmar and cambodia. in october 2009, the asean intergovernmental commission on human rights was inaugurated, and subsequently, the asean human rights declaration was adopted unanimously by asean members on 18 november 2012.\\nthe arab charter on human rights (achr) was adopted by the council of the league of arab states on 22 may 2004.\\n\\n\\n=== europe ===\\n\\nthe council of europe, founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for european integration. it is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the united nations. the seat of the council of europe is in strasbourg in france. the council of europe is responsible for both the european convention on human rights and the european court of human rights. these institutions bind the council\\'s members to a code of human rights which, though strict, are more lenient than those of the united nations charter on human rights. the council also promotes the european charter for regional or minority languages and the european social charter. membership is open to all european states which seek european integration, accept the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.the council of europe is an organisation that is not part of the european union, but the latter is expected to accede to the european convention and potentially the council itself. the eu  has its own human rights document; the charter of fundamental rights of the european union.the european convention on human rights defines and guarantees since 1950 human rights and fundamental freedoms in europe. all 47 member states of the council of europe have signed this convention and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights in strasbourg. in order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment (article 3 of the convention), the european committee for the prevention of torture was established.\\n\\n\\n== philosophies of human rights ==\\nseveral theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights become part of social expectations.\\none of the oldest western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds.\\nother theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with hume). human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of weber). these approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in rawls) – a social contract.\\n\\n\\n=== natural rights ===\\n\\nnatural law theories base human rights on a \"natural\" moral, religious or even biological order which is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.\\nsocrates and his philosophic heirs, plato and aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (dikaion physikon, δικαιον φυσικον, latin ius naturale).  of these, aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law, although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work of thomas aquinas.the development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the stoics.some of the early church fathers sought to incorporate the until then pagan concept of natural law into christianity. natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of thomas aquinas, francisco suárez, richard hooker, thomas hobbes, hugo grotius, samuel von pufendorf, and john locke.\\nin the seventeenth century thomas hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). the natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. it was discovered by considering humankind\\'s natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law.  in hobbes\\' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. in this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.\\nhugo grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law. he wrote that \"even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate\" natural law, which \"would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no god or that he does not care for human affairs.\" (de iure belli ac pacis, prolegomeni xi). this is the famous argument etiamsi daremus (non-esse deum), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.\\njohn locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in two treatises of government. locke turned hobbes\\' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect \"life, liberty, and property,\" people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.\\nthe belgian philosopher of law frank van dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition. there are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.the term \"human rights\" has replaced the term \"natural rights\" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.\\n\\n\\n=== other theories of human rights ===\\nthe philosopher john finnis argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being. interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:\\n\\nhuman rights law, applied to a state\\'s own citizens serves the interest of states, by, for example, minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable\\n\\nthe biological theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and altruism in the context of natural selection.\\n\\n\\n== concepts in human rights ==\\n\\n\\n=== indivisibility and categorization of rights ===\\nthe most common categorization of human rights is to split them into civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.\\ncivil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the universal declaration of human rights and in the iccpr. economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the universal declaration of human rights and in the icescr. the udhr included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:\\n\\nthe ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights\\n\\nthis is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the full belly thesis)\\nalthough accepted by the signaturies to the udhr, most of them do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. for example, in the united states there is no universal access to healthcare free at the point of use. that is not to say that western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely (the welfare states that exist in western europe are evidence of this). similarly the ex soviet bloc countries and asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.\\nanother categorization, offered by karel vasak, is that there are three generations of human rights: first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. this categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. human rights expert philip alston argues:\\n\\nif every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.\\n\\nhe, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:\\n\\n...the call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.\\n\\npriorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.\\n\\nsome human rights are said to be \"inalienable rights.\"  the term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to \"a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered.\"\\nthe adherence to the principle of indivisibility by the international community was reaffirmed in 1995:\\n\\nall human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.\\n\\nthis statement was again endorsed at the 2005 world summit in new york (paragraph 121).\\n\\n\\n=== universalism vs cultural relativism ===\\n\\nthe udhr enshrines, by definition, rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to.\\nproponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal, and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival.\\nrights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women. for example, female genital mutilation occurs in different cultures in africa, asia and south america. it is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. it is considered a violation of women\\'s and girl\\'s rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.\\nuniversalism has been described by some as cultural, economic or political imperialism. in particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in europe, japan or north america, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.\\nfor example, in 1981, the iranian representative to the united nations, said rajaie-khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the universal declaration of human rights by saying that the udhr was \"a secular understanding of the judeo-christian tradition\", which could not be implemented by muslims without trespassing the islamic law. the former prime ministers of singapore, lee kuan yew, and of malaysia, mahathir bin mohamad both claimed in the 1990s that asian values were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in asia than democracy. this view is countered by mahathir\\'s former deputy:\\n\\nto say that freedom is western or unasian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.\\n\\nand also by singapore\\'s opposition leader chee soon juan who states that it is racist to assert that asians do not want human rights.an appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers, such as john locke and john stuart mill, have all been western and indeed that some were involved in the running of empires themselves.relativistic arguments tend to neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the udhr in 1948. they also don\\'t account for the fact that the udhr was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a us roman catholic, a chinese confucian philosopher, a french zionist and a representative from the arab league, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as mahatma gandhi.michael ignatieff has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless. this reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.\\nalthough the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. the 2005 world summit reaffirmed the international community\\'s adherence to this principle:\\n\\nthe universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.\\n\\n\\n=== state and non-state actors ===\\ncompanies, ngos, political parties, informal groups, and individuals are known as non-state actors. non-state actors can also commit human rights abuses, but are not subject to human rights law other than international humanitarian law, which applies to individuals.\\nmulti-national companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses. although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multi-national companies is both controversial and ill-defined. multi-national companies\\' primary responsibility is to their shareholders, not to those affected by their actions. such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. no international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable. jean ziegler, special rapporteur of the un commission on human rights on the right to food stated in a report in 2003:\\n\\nthe growing power of transnational corporations and their extension of power through privatization, deregulation and the rolling back of the state also mean that it is now time to develop binding legal norms that hold corporations to human rights standards and circumscribe potential abuses of their position of power.\\n\\nin august 2003 the human rights commission\\'s sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights produced draft norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights. these were considered by the human rights commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored.\\n\\n\\n== human rights law ==\\n\\n\\n=== human rights vs national security ===\\n\\nrealism and national loyalties have been described as a destructive influence on the human rights movement because they deny people\\'s innately similar human qualities.with the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable), the un recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency – although\\n\\nthe emergency must be actual, affect the whole population and the threat must be to the very existence of the nation. the declaration of emergency must also be a last resort and a temporary measure\\n\\nrights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as peremptory norms or jus cogens. such international law obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.\\n\\n\\n=== legal instruments and jurisdiction ===\\n\\nthe human rights enshrined in the udhr, the geneva conventions and the various enforced treaties of the united nations are enforceable in law. in practice, many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them.\\nthere exist a number of internationally recognized organisations with worldwide mandate or jurisdiction over certain aspects of human rights:\\n\\nthe international court of justice is the united nations\\' primary judiciary body. it has worldwide jurisdiction. it is directed by the security council. the icj settles disputes between nations. the icj does not have jurisdiction over individuals.\\nthe international criminal court is the body responsible for investigating and punishing war crimes, and crimes against humanity when such occur within its jurisdiction, with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in 2002. a number of un members have not joined the court and the icc does not have jurisdiction over their citizens, and others have signed but not yet ratified the rome statute, which established the court.the icc and other international courts (see regional human rights above exist to take action where the national legal system of a state is unable to try the case itself. if national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation, it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity. only when all local remedies have been exhausted does international law take effect.in over 110 countries national human rights institutions (nhris) have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country. although not all nhris are compliant with the paris principles, the number and effect of these institutions is increasing. the paris principles were defined at the first international workshop on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in paris on 7–9 october 1991, and adopted by united nations human rights commission resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and the general assembly resolution 48/134 of 1993. the paris principles list a number of responsibilities for national institutions.universal jurisdiction is a controversial principle in international law whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting country. the state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish. the concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens. in 1993 belgium passed a law of universal jurisdiction to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries, and in 1998 augusto pinochet was arrested in london following an indictment by spanish judge baltasar garzon under the universal jurisdiction principle. the principle is supported by amnesty international and other human rights organisations as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act, but others, including henry kissinger (who has himself been accused of war crimes by several commentators), argue that state sovereignty is paramount, because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states\\' sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons.\\n\\n\\n=== human rights violations ===\\n\\nhuman rights violations occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any of the terms of the udhr or other international human rights or humanitarian law. in regard to human rights violations of united nations laws. article 39 of the united nations charter designates the un security council (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine un human rights violations.\\nhuman rights abuses are monitored by united nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent non-governmental organizations, such as amnesty international, human rights watch, world organisation against torture, freedom house, international freedom of expression exchange and anti-slavery international. these organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights\\nwars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, are breaches of international humanitarian law.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\nanimal

              "       ['television (tv), sometimes shortened to tele or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white), or in colour, and in two or three dimensions and sound. the term can refer to a television set, a television program (\"tv show\"), or the medium of television transmission. television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment and news.\\ntelevision became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. after world war ii, an improved form of black-and-white tv broadcasting became popular in the united states and britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. during the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. in the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the us and most other developed countries. the availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as betamax and vhs tapes, high-capacity hard disk drives, dvds, flash drives, high-definition blu-ray discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. for many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud. at the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. another development was the move from standard-definition television (sdtv) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (hdtv), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. hdtv may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. since 2010, with the invention of smart television, internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the internet through streaming video services such as netflix, amazon video, iplayer and hulu.\\nin 2013, 79% of the world\\'s households owned a television set. the replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (crt) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as lcds (both fluorescent-backlit and led), oled displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. most tv sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly leds. major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of crt, dlp, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit lcds by the mid-2010s. in the near future, leds are expected to be gradually replaced by oleds. also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart tvs in the mid-2010s. smart tvs with integrated internet and web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the internet. until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. a standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. a visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.\\n\\n\\n== etymology ==\\nthe word television comes from ancient greek  τῆλε (tèle), meaning \\'far\\', and latin  visio, meaning \\'sight\\'. the first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the russian scientist constantin perskyi used it in a paper that he presented in french at the 1st international congress of electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 august 1900 during the international world fair in paris. the anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still \"...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over telegraph or telephone wires\". it was \"...formed in english or borrowed from french télévision.\" in the 19th century and early 20th century, other \"...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904).\" the abbreviation \"tv\" is from 1948. the use of the term to mean \"a television set\" dates from 1941. the use of the term to mean \"television as a medium\" dates from 1927. the slang term \"telly\" is more common in the uk. the slang term \"the tube\" or the \"boob tube\" derives from the bulky cathode ray tube used on most tvs until the advent of flat-screen tvs. another slang term for the tv is \"idiot box\". also, in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, during the early rapid growth of television programming and television-set ownership in the united states, another slang term became widely used in that period and continues to be used today to distinguish productions originally created for broadcast on television from films developed for presentation in movie theaters. the \"small screen\", as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the \"big screen\" was used to identify productions made for theatrical release.\\n\\n\\n== history ==\\n\\n\\n=== mechanical ===\\n\\nfacsimile transmission systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. alexander bain introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. frederick bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851. willoughby smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873. as a 23-year-old german university student, paul julius gottlieb nipkow proposed and patented the nipkow disk in 1884. this was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. although he never built a working model of the system, variations of nipkow\\'s spinning-disk \"image rasterizer\" became exceedingly common. constantin perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the international electricity congress at the international world fair in paris on 24 august 1900. perskyi\\'s paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of nipkow and others. however, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by lee de forest and arthur korn, among others, made the design practical.the first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by georges rignoux and a. fournier in paris in 1909. a matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. in the receiver, a type of kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. a separate circuit regulated synchronization. the 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. an updated image was transmitted \"several times\" each second.in 1911, boris rosing and his student vladimir zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in zworykin\\'s words, \"very crude images\" over wires to the \"braun tube\" (cathode ray tube or \"crt\") in the receiver. moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: \"the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy\".in 1921, edouard belin sent the first image via radio waves with his belinograph.\\n\\nby the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, scottish inventor john logie baird employed the nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. on 25 march 1925, baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at selfridge\\'s department store in london. since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist\\'s dummy named \"stooky bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. by 26 january 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. this is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. the subject was baird\\'s business partner oliver hutchinson. baird\\'s system used the nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. a bright light shining through a spinning nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. a selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. this was transmitted by am radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. the brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. as each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. baird\\'s disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. in 1927, baird transmitted a signal over 438 miles (705 km) of telephone line between london and glasgow.in 1928, baird\\'s company (baird television development company/cinema television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between london and new york, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. in 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in germany. in november of the same year, baird and bernard natan of pathé established france\\'s first television company, télévision-baird-natan. in 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of the derby. in 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. baird\\'s mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on bbc television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. instead a 17.5mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.an american inventor, charles francis jenkins, also pioneered the television. he published an article on \"motion pictures by wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until december 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 june 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. in 1925 jenkins used the nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of 5 miles (8 km), from a naval radio station in maryland to his laboratory in washington, d.c., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution. he was granted u.s. patent no. 1,544,156 (transmitting pictures over wireless) on 30 june 1925 (filed 13 march 1922).herbert e. ives and frank gray of bell telephone laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 april 1927. their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. the small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen (5 by 6 cm). the large receiver had a screen 24 inches wide by 30 inches high (60 by 75 cm). both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. the system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from washington to new york city, then a radio link from whippany, new jersey. comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. subjects of the telecast included secretary of commerce herbert hoover. a flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects. the scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. the disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (today\\'s systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) television historian albert abramson underscored the significance of the bell labs demonstration: \"it was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. it would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"in 1928, wrgb, then w2xb, was started as the world\\'s first television station. it broadcast from the general electric facility in schenectady, ny. it was popularly known as \"wgy television\". meanwhile, in the soviet union, léon theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926. as part of his thesis, on 7 may 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a 5-square-foot (0.46 m2) screen.by 1927, theremin had achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until may 1932 by rca, with 120 lines.on 25 december 1926, kenjiro takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a nipkow disk scanner and crt display at hamamatsu industrial high school in japan. this prototype is still on display at the takayanagi memorial museum in shizuoka university, hamamatsu campus. his research in creating a production model was halted by the scap after world war ii.because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the uk broadcasts using the baird system were remarkably clear. a few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. two of these were the 180-line system that compagnie des compteurs (cdc) installed in paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that peck television corp. started in 1935 at station ve9ak in montreal. the advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. the last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the united states.\\n\\n\\n=== electronic ===\\n\\nin 1897, english physicist j. j. thomson was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern cathode ray tube (crt). the earliest version of the crt was invented by the german physicist ferdinand braun in 1897 and is also known as the \"braun\" tube. it was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the crookes tube, with a phosphor-coated screen. in 1906 the germans max dieckmann and gustav glage produced raster images for the first time in a crt. in 1907, russian scientist boris rosing used a crt in the receiving end of an experimental video signal to form a picture. he managed to display simple geometric shapes onto the screen.in 1908 alan archibald campbell-swinton, fellow of the royal society (uk), published a letter in the scientific journal nature in which he described how \"distant electric vision\" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device, he expanded on his vision in a speech given in london in 1911 and reported in the times and the journal of the röntgen society. in a letter to nature published in october 1926, campbell-swinton also announced the results of some \"not very successful experiments\" he had conducted with g. m. minchin and j. c. m. stanton. they had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. these experiments were conducted before march 1914, when minchin died, but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by h. miller and j. w. strange from emi, and by h. iams and a. rose from rca. both teams succeeded in transmitting \"very faint\" images with the original campbell-swinton\\'s selenium-coated plate. although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. the first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by john b. johnson (who gave his name to the term johnson noise) and harry weiner weinhart of western electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.in 1926, hungarian engineer kálmán tihanyi designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of \"charge storage\" within the scanning (or \"camera\") tube. the problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or \"camera\" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by kálmán tihanyi beginning in 1924. his solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (\"photoelectrons\") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. the device was first described in a patent application he filed in hungary in march 1926 for a television system he dubbed \"radioskop\". after further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, tihanyi\\'s patent was declared void in great britain in 1930, so he applied for patents in the united states. although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of rca\\'s \"iconoscope\" in 1931, the u.s. patent for tihanyi\\'s transmitting tube would not be granted until may 1939. the patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous october. both patents had been purchased by rca prior to their approval. charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day. on 25 december 1926, at hamamatsu industrial high school in japan, japanese inventor kenjiro takayanagi demonstrated a tv system with a 40-line resolution that employed a crt display. this was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. takayanagi did not apply for a patent.on 7 september 1927, american inventor philo farnsworth\\'s image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 green street in san francisco. by 3 september 1928, farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. this is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration. in 1929, the system was improved further by the elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. that year, farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife elma (\"pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\\n\\nmeanwhile, vladimir zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. while working for westinghouse electric in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. but in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary. zworykin\\'s imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. but rca, which acquired the westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for farnsworth\\'s 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. thus rca, on the basis of zworykin\\'s 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against farnsworth. the u.s. patent office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for farnsworth against zworykin. farnsworth claimed that zworykin\\'s 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application; he also divided his original application in 1931. zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. in september 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts, and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, rca agreed to pay farnsworth us$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.in 1933, rca introduced an improved camera tube that relied on tihanyi\\'s charge storage principle. dubbed the \"iconoscope\" by zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was claimed to be much more sensitive than farnsworth\\'s image dissector. however, farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his image dissector through the invention of a completely unique \"multipactor\" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. this small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. unfortunately, a problem with the multipactor was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.at the berlin radio show in august 1931, manfred von ardenne gave a public demonstration of a television system using a crt for both transmission and reception. however, ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the crt instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film. philo farnsworth gave the world\\'s first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the franklin institute of philadelphia on 25 august 1934, and for ten days afterwards. mexican inventor guillermo gonzález camarena also played an important role in early tv. his experiments with tv (known as telectroescopía at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the \"trichromatic field sequential system\" color television in 1940. in britain, the emi engineering team led by isaac shoenberg applied in 1932 for a patent for a new device they dubbed \"the emitron\", which formed the heart of the cameras they designed for the bbc. on 2 november 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the emitron began at studios in alexandra palace, and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the victorian building\\'s towers. it alternated for a short time with baird\\'s mechanical system in adjoining studios, but was more reliable and visibly superior. this was the world\\'s first regular \"high-definition\" television service.the original american iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. the emi team, under the supervision of isaac shoenberg, analyzed how the iconoscope (or emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. they solved this problem by developing, and patenting in 1934, two new camera tubes dubbed super-emitron and cps emitron. the super-emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. it was used for outside broadcasting by the bbc, for the first time, on armistice day 1937, when the general public could watch on a television set as the king laid a wreath at the cenotaph. this was the first time that anyone had broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings, because neither farnsworth nor rca would do the same until the 1939 new york world\\'s fair.\\n\\non the other hand, in 1934, zworykin shared some patent rights with the german licensee company telefunken. the \"image iconoscope\" (\"superikonoskop\" in germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. this tube is essentially identical to the super-emitron. the production and commercialization of the super-emitron and image iconoscope in europe were not affected by the patent war between zworykin and farnsworth, because dieckmann and hell had priority in germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their lichtelektrische bildzerlegerröhre für fernseher (photoelectric image dissector tube for television) in germany in 1925, two years before farnsworth did the same in the united states. the image iconoscope (superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. indeed, it was the representative of the european tradition in electronic tubes competing against the american tradition represented by the image orthicon. the german company heimann produced the superikonoskop for the 1936 berlin olympic games, later heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955; finally the dutch company philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.american television broadcasting, at the time, consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941. rca, for example, used only iconoscopes in the new york area, but farnsworth image dissectors in philadelphia and san francisco. in september 1939, rca agreed to pay the farnsworth television and radio corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to farnsworth\\'s patents. with this historic agreement in place, rca integrated much of what was best about the farnsworth technology into their systems. in 1941, the united states implemented 525-line television. electrical engineer benjamin adler played a prominent role in the development of television.the world\\'s first 625-line television standard was designed in the soviet union in 1944 and became a national standard in 1946. the first broadcast in 625-line standard occurred in moscow in 1948. the concept of 625 lines per frame was subsequently implemented in the european ccir standard. in 1936, kálmán tihanyi described the principle of plasma display, the first flat panel display system.early electronic television sets were large and bulky, with analog circuits made of vacuum tubes. following the invention of the first working transistor at bell labs, sony founder masaru ibuka predicted in 1952 that the transition to electronic circuits made of transistors would lead to smaller and more portable television sets. the first fully transistorized, portable solid-state television set was the 8-inch sony tv8-301, developed in 1959 and released in 1960. this began the transformation of television viewership from a communal viewing experience to a solitary viewing experience. by 1960, sony had sold over 4 million portable television sets worldwide.\\n\\n\\n=== colour ===\\n\\nthe basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a colour image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by maurice le blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning. polish inventor jan szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. but his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it. another inventor, hovannes adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. the first color television project is claimed by him, and was patented in germany on 31 march 1908, patent no. 197183, then in britain, on 1 april 1908, patent no. 7219, in france (patent no. 390326) and in russia in 1910 (patent no. 17912).scottish inventor john logie baird demonstrated the world\\'s first color transmission on 3 july 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. baird also made the world\\'s first color broadcast on 4 february 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from baird\\'s crystal palace studios to a projection screen at london\\'s dominion theatre. mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by bell laboratories in june 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.\\nthe first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by john logie baird. in 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. this device was very \"deep\", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console. however, baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a british government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.\\nin 1939, hungarian engineer peter carl goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at cbs, which contained an iconoscope sensor. the cbs field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. the system was first demonstrated to the federal communications commission (fcc) on 29 august 1940, and shown to the press on 4 september.cbs began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 august 1940, and live cameras by 12 november. nbc (owned by rca) made its first field test of color television on 20 february 1941. cbs began daily color field tests on 1 june 1941. these color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to rca and cbs engineers and the invited press. the war production board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 april 1942 to 20 august 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.as early as 1940, baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called telechrome. early telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. the phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. he also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3d image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). a demonstration on 16 august 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. work on the telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. however, baird\\'s untimely death in 1946 ended development of the telechrome system.\\nsimilar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. the geer tube was similar to baird\\'s concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of baird\\'s 3d patterning on a flat surface. the penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. the chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\\none of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. in the united states, after considerable research, the national television systems committee approved an all-electronic system developed by rca, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. as black-and-white tvs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] \"compatible\". (\"compatible color\", featured in rca advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song \"america\", of west side story, 1957.) the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. the ntsc standard represented a major technical achievement.\\n\\nthe first color broadcast (the first episode of the live program the marriage (tv series)) occurred on 8 july 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. it was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. the first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. in 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\\nearly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. ge\\'s relatively compact and lightweight porta-color set was introduced in the spring of 1966. it used a transistor-based uhf tuner. the first fully transistorized color television in the united states was the quasar television introduced in 1967. these developments made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition.\\nthe mosfet (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or mos transistor) was invented by mohamed m. atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs in 1959, and presented in 1960. by the mid-1960s, rca were using mosfets in their consumer television products. rca laboratories researchers w.m. austin, j.a. dean, d.m. griswold and o.p. hart in 1966 described the use of the mosfet in television circuits, including rf amplifier, low-level video, chroma and agc circuits. the power mosfet was later widely adopted for television receiver circuits.in 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. color broadcasting in europe was not standardized on the pal format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. by this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in europe was fairly rapid. by the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered uhf stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. by 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, b&w sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. by the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.\\n\\n\\n=== digital ===\\n\\ndigital television (dtv) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. due to data compression, digital tv can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. it is an innovative service that represents the most significant evolution in television broadcast technology since color television emerged in the 1950s. digital tv\\'s roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. it was not until the 1990s that digital tv became feasible. digital television was previously not practically feasible due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed digital video, requiring around 200 mbps bit-rate for a standard-definition television (sdtv) signal, and over 1 gbps for high-definition television (hdtv).digital tv became practically feasible in the early 1990s due to a major technological development, discrete cosine transform (dct) video compression. dct coding is a lossy compression technique that was first proposed for image compression by nasir ahmed in 1972, and was later adapted into a motion-compensated dct video coding algorithm, for video coding standards such as the h.26x formats from 1988 onwards and the mpeg formats from 1991 onwards. motion-compensated dct video compression significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth required for a digital tv signal. dct coding compressed down the bandwidth requirements of digital television signals to about 34 mpps bit-rate for sdtv and around 70–140 mbps for hdtv while maintaining near-studio-quality transmission, making digital television a practical reality in the 1990s.a digital tv service was proposed in 1986 by nippon telegraph and telephone (ntt) and the ministry of posts and telecommunication (mpt) in japan, where there were plans to develop an \"integrated network system\" service. however, it was not possible to practically implement such a digital tv service until the adoption of dct video compression technology made it possible in the early 1990s.in the mid-1980s, as japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of hdtv technology, the muse analog format proposed by nhk, a japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse u.s. electronics companies\\' technologies. until june 1990, the japanese muse standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. then, an american company, general instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. this breakthrough was of such significance that the fcc was persuaded to delay its decision on an atv standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\\nin march 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the fcc made a number of critical decisions. first, the commission declared that the new atv standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine hdtv signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new atv standard must be capable of being \"simulcast\" on different channels.(8)the new atv standard also allowed the new dtv signal to be based on entirely new design principles. although incompatible with the existing ntsc standard, the new dtv standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\\nthe final standards adopted by the fcc did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. this compromise resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital hdtv compatible display devices. interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue crt display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. in fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth. another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early crt screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration. however interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as liquid-crystal (lcd), for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.progressive scanning, the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. the computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. it also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. the film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. for their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. william f. schreiber, who was director of the advanced television research program at the massachusetts institute of technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.digital television transition started in late 2000s. all governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped tvs were costly. but soon, as the price of digital-capable tvs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. the transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.\\n\\n\\n=== smart tv ===\\n\\nthe advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart tvs. a smart television, sometimes referred to as connected tv or hybrid tv, is a television set or set-top box with integrated internet and web 2.0 features, and is an example of technological convergence between computers, television sets and set-top boxes. besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices can also provide internet tv, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. these tvs come pre-loaded with an operating system.smart tv should not to be confused with internet tv, internet protocol television (iptv) or with web tv. internet television refers to the receiving of television content over the internet instead of by traditional systems—terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods). iptv is one of the emerging internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. web television (webtv) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on internet tv. a first patent was filed in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an \"intelligent\" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user\\'s demand, and process their needs. major tv manufacturers have announced production of smart tvs only, for middle-end and high-end tvs in 2015. smart tvs have gotten more affordable compared to when they were first introduced, with 46 million of u.s. households having at least one as of 2019. \\n\\n\\n=== 3d ===\\n\\n3d television conveys depth perception to the viewer by employing techniques such as stereoscopic display, multi-view display, 2d-plus-depth, or any other form of 3d display. most modern 3d television sets use an active shutter 3d system or a polarized 3d system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need of glasses. stereoscopic 3d television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 august 1928, by john logie baird in his company\\'s premises at 133 long acre, london. baird pioneered a variety of 3d television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. the first 3d tv was produced in 1935. the advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3d tvs. although 3d tv sets are quite popular for watching 3d home media such as on blu-ray discs, 3d programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. many 3d television channels which started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s. according to displaysearch 3d televisions shipments totaled 41.45 million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010. as of late 2013, the number of 3d tv viewers started to decline.\\n\\n\\n== broadcast systems ==\\n\\n\\n=== terrestrial television ===\\n\\nprogramming is broadcast by television stations, sometimes called \"channels\", as stations are licensed by their governments to broadcast only over assigned channels in the television band. at first, terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because bandwidth was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of channels available, government regulation was the norm. in the u.s., the federal communications commission (fcc) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in july 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. by contrast, the united kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the british broadcasting corporation (bbc), which had public service as part of its royal charter.\\nwrgb claims to be the world\\'s oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 january 1928, broadcasting from the general electric factory in schenectady, ny, under the call letters w2xb. it was popularly known as \"wgy television\" after its sister radio station. later in 1928, general electric started a second facility, this one in new york city, which had the call letters w2xbs and which today is known as wnbc. the two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. the image of a felix the cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. on 2 november 1936, the bbc began transmitting the world\\'s first public regular high-definition service from the victorian alexandra palace in north london. it therefore claims to be the birthplace of tv broadcasting as we know it today.\\nwith the widespread adoption of cable across the united states in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of us households used an antenna. a slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (catv) for cord cutters. all other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.\\n\\n\\n=== cable television ===\\n \\n\\ncable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (rf) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. this contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. in the 2000s, fm radio programming, high-speed internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. the abbreviation catv is often used for cable television. it originally stood for community access television or community antenna television, from cable television\\'s origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. the origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some european cities as far back as 1924. earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.\\n\\n\\n=== satellite television ===\\n\\nsatellite television is a system of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. the signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (lnb). a satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set. receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.\\nthe most common method of reception is direct-broadcast satellite television (dbstv), also known as \"direct to home\" (dth). in dbstv systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the ku wavelength and are completely digital. satellite tv systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only. these systems received analog signals transmitted in the c-band spectrum from fss type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. consequently, these systems were nicknamed \"big dish\" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.the direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. digital signals may include high-definition television (hdtv). some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription.\\nin 1945, british science fiction writer arthur c. clarke proposed a worldwide communications system which would function by means of three satellites equally spaced apart in earth orbit. this was published in the october 1945 issue of the wireless world magazine and won him the franklin institute\\'s stuart ballantine medal in 1963.the first satellite television signals from europe to north america were relayed via the telstar satellite over the atlantic ocean on 23 july 1962. the signals were received and broadcast in north american and european countries and watched by over 100 million. launched in 1962, the relay 1 satellite was the first satellite to transmit television signals from the us to japan. the first geosynchronous communication satellite, syncom 2, was launched on 26 july 1963.the world\\'s first commercial communications satellite, called intelsat i and nicknamed \"early bird\", was launched into geosynchronous orbit on 6 april 1965. the first national network of television satellites, called orbita, was created by the soviet union in october 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to ground downlink stations. the first commercial north american satellite to carry television transmissions was canada\\'s geostationary anik 1, which was launched on 9 november 1972. ats-6, the world\\'s first experimental educational and direct broadcast satellite (dbs), was launched on 30 may 1974. it transmitted at 860 mhz using wideband fm modulation and had two sound channels. the transmissions were focused on the indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in western europe using home constructed equipment that drew on uhf television design techniques already in use.the first in a series of soviet geostationary satellites to carry direct-to-home television, ekran 1, was launched on 26 october 1976. it used a 714 mhz uhf downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing uhf television technology rather than microwave technology.\\n\\n\\n=== internet television ===\\n\\ninternet television (internet tv) (or online television) is the digital distribution of television content via the internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. internet television should not be confused with smart tv, iptv or with web tv. smart television refers to the tv set which has a built-in operating system. internet protocol television (iptv) is one of the emerging internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on internet tv.\\n\\n\\n== sets ==\\n\\na television set, also called a television receiver, television, tv set, tv, or \"telly\", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after world war ii in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. the addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. the ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as betamax and vhs, which enabled viewers to record tv shows and watch prerecorded movies. in the subsequent decades, tvs were used to watch dvds and blu-ray discs of movies and other content. major tv manufacturers announced the discontinuation of crt, dlp, plasma and fluorescent-backlit lcds by the mid-2010s. televisions since 2010s mostly use leds. leds are expected to be gradually replaced by oleds in the near future.\\n\\n\\n=== display technologies ===\\n\\n\\n==== disk ====\\n\\nthe earliest systems employed a spinning disk to create and reproduce images. these usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.\\n\\n\\n==== crt ====\\n\\nthe cathode ray tube (crt) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns (a source of electrons or electron emitter) and a fluorescent screen used to view images.\\nit has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. the images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets or others. the crt uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. as a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most x-ray emissions, particularly if the crt is used in a consumer product.\\nin television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. an image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. in all modern crt monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument.\\n\\n\\n==== dlp ====\\n\\ndigital light processing (dlp) is a type of video projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device. some dlps have a tv tuner, which makes them a type of tv display. it was originally developed in 1987 by dr. larry hornbeck of texas instruments. while the dlp imaging device was invented by texas instruments, the first dlp based projector was introduced by digital projection ltd in 1997. digital projection and texas instruments were both awarded emmy awards in 1998 for invention of the dlp projector technology. dlp is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. dlp technology is used in dlp front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. dlp is also used in dlp rear projection television sets and digital signs. it is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection.\\n\\n\\n==== plasma ====\\n\\na plasma display panel (pdp) is a type of flat panel display common to large tv displays 30 inches (76 cm) or larger. they are called \"plasma\" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases, or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps.\\n\\n\\n==== lcd ====\\n\\nliquid-crystal-display televisions (lcd tv) are television sets that use lcd display technology to produce images. lcd televisions are much thinner and lighter than cathode ray tube (crts) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). when manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made lcds practical for television receivers. lcds come in two types: those using cold cathode fluorescent lamps, simply called lcds and those using led as backlight called as leds.\\nin 2007, lcd televisions surpassed sales of crt-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. lcd tvs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the plasma display panel and rear-projection television. in mid 2010s lcds especially leds became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type. lcds also have disadvantages. other technologies address these weaknesses, including oleds, fed and sed, but as of 2014 none of these have entered widespread production.\\n\\n\\n==== oled ====\\n\\nan oled (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting diode (led) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. this layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes. generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. oleds are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens. it is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and pdas.\\nthere are two main families of oled: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. adding mobile ions to an oled creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or lec, which has a slightly different mode of operation. oled displays can use either passive-matrix (pmoled) or active-matrix (amoled) addressing schemes. active-matrix oleds require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.\\nan oled display works without a backlight. thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (lcd). in low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an oled screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an lcd, whether the lcd uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or led backlight. oleds are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.\\n\\n\\n=== display resolution ===\\n\\n\\n==== ld ====\\n\\nlow-definition television or ldtv refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such 240p (320*240). it is used in handheld television. the most common source of ldtv programming is the internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution video files could overwhelm computer servers and take too long to download. many mobile phones and portable devices such as apple\\'s ipod nano, or sony\\'s playstation portable use ldtv video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens (320×240 and 480×272 pixels respectively). the current generation of ipod nanos have ldtv screens, as do the first three generations of ipod touch and iphone (480×320). for the first years of its existence, youtube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. a standard, consumer grade vhs videotape can be considered sdtv due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).\\n\\n\\n==== sd ====\\n\\nstandard-definition television or sdtv refers to two different resolutions: 576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution, derived from the european-developed pal and secam systems; and 480i based on the american national television system committee ntsc system. sdtv is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either high-definition television (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 1440p, 4k uhdtv, and 8k uhd) or enhanced-definition television (edtv 480p). in north america, digital sdtv is broadcast in the same 4:3 aspect ratio as ntsc signals with widescreen content being center cut. however, in other parts of the world that used the pal or secam color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a 16:9 aspect ratio, with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the us as 4:3 with non-atsc countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a pillarboxed image.\\n\\n\\n==== hd ====\\n\\nhigh-definition television (hdtv) provides a resolution that is substantially higher than that of standard-definition television.\\nhdtv may be transmitted in various formats:\\n\\n1080p: 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 megapixels) per frame\\n1080i: 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 mp) per field or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 mp) per frame\\na non-standard cea resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 mp) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 mp) per frame\\n720p: 1280×720p: 921,600 pixels (~0.92 mp) per frame\\n\\n\\n==== uhd ====\\n\\nultra-high-definition television (also known as super hi-vision, ultra hd television, ultrahd, uhdtv, or uhd) includes 4k uhd (2160p) and 8k uhd (4320p), which are two digital video formats proposed by nhk science & technology research laboratories and defined and approved by the international telecommunication union (itu). the consumer electronics association announced on 17 october 2012, that \"ultra high definition\", or \"ultra hd\", would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.\\n\\n\\n=== market share ===\\nnorth american consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years, and the average household owns 2.8 televisions. as of 2011, 48 million are sold each year at an average price of $460 and size of 38 in (97 cm).\\n\\n\\n== content ==\\n\\n\\n=== programming ===\\n\\ngetting tv programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. after production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. this typically happens on two levels:\\n\\noriginal run or first run: a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same.\\nbroadcast syndication: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). it includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. in many cases, other companies, tv stations, or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.first-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the us, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic free-to-air (fta) elsewhere. this practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only fta channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on fta. unlike the us, repeat fta screenings of an fta network program usually only occur on that network. also, affiliates rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on local programming.\\n\\n\\n=== genres ===\\ntelevision genres include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. the most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic miniseries. however, other genres, such as historical western genres, may also have high production costs.\\npopular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. as well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas. science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as south park.\\nthe least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or master of ceremonies. there is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. reality tv shows \"regular\" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (cops) to significant weight loss (the biggest loser). a variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (the osbournes, snoop dogg\\'s father hood) or doing regular jobs (the simple life).\\nfictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are \"quality television\", include series such as twin peaks and the sopranos. kristin thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in art films, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are \"quality television\", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.\\n\\n\\n=== funding ===\\n\\naround the globe, broadcast tv is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. to protect revenues, subscription tv channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. unencrypted channels are known as free to air or fta. in 2009, the global tv market represented 1,217.2 million tv households with at least one tv and total revenues of 268.9 billion eur (declining 1.2% compared to 2008). north america had the biggest tv revenue market share with 39% followed by europe (31%), asia-pacific (21%), latin america (8%), and africa and the middle east (2%). globally, the different tv revenue sources divide into 45–50% tv advertising revenues, 40–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.\\n\\n\\n==== advertising ====\\n\\ntv\\'s broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. many tv networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers (\"sponsors\") to fund their programming. television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in american english, and known in british english as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. the vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length infomercials). advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.\\n\\nthe effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as marshall mcluhan. the viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as nielsen media research, is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a \"daypart\"). in many countries, including the united states, television campaign advertisements are considered indispensable for a political campaign. in other countries, such as france, political advertising on television is heavily restricted, while some countries, such as norway, completely ban political advertisements.\\nthe first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the united states on 1 july 1941 over new york station wnbt (now wnbc) before a baseball game between the brooklyn dodgers and philadelphia phillies. the announcement for bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a wnbt test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. the bulova logo, with the phrase \"bulova watch time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute. the first tv ad broadcast in the uk was on itv on 22 september 1955, advertising gibbs sr toothpaste. the first tv ad broadcast in asia was on nippon television in tokyo on 28 august 1953, advertising seikosha (now seiko), which also displayed a clock with the current time.\\n\\n\\n==== united states ====\\nsince inception in the us in 1941, television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. during the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. this, in turn, gave great creative license to the advertisers over the content of the show. perhaps due to the quiz show scandals in the 1950s, networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.\\nus advertising rates are determined primarily by nielsen ratings. the time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a tv commercial can cost. for example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular american idol, while the same amount of time for the super bowl can cost several million dollars. conversely, lesser-viewed time slots, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of infomercials at far lower rates. in recent years, the paid program or infomercial has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. some drug companies and other businesses have even created \"news\" items for broadcast, known in the industry as video news releases, paying program directors to use them.some tv programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films and known as product placement. for example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular chain restaurant, or driving a certain make of car. (this is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a product placement). sometimes, a specific brand or trade mark, or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (this excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)\\n\\n\\n==== united kingdom ====\\nthe tv regulator oversees tv advertising in the united kingdom. its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded tv. despite this, an early tv mogul, roy thomson, likened the broadcasting licence as being a \"licence to print money\". restrictions mean that the big three national commercial tv channels: itv, channel 4, and channel 5 can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). this means that many imported tv shows from the us have unnatural pauses where the uk company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent us advertising. advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program or during a formal royal ceremony or occasion. there also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. the bbc, being strictly non-commercial, is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the uk, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. the majority of its budget comes from television license fees (see below) and broadcast syndication, the sale of content to other broadcasters.\\n\\n\\n==== ireland ====\\nbroadcast advertising is regulated by the broadcasting authority of ireland.\\n\\n\\n==== subscription ====\\nsome tv channels are partly funded from subscriptions; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch pay television or specialty channels. most subscription services are also funded by advertising.\\n\\n\\n==== taxation or license ====\\ntelevision services in some countries may be funded by a television licence or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. for example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:\\n\\naustralia (abc)\\nbelgium (rtbf)\\ndenmark (dr)\\nireland (rté)\\njapan (nhk)\\nnorway (nrk)\\nsweden (svt)\\nunited kingdom (bbc)\\nunited states (pbs)the bbc carries no television advertising on its uk channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live tv broadcasts. currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8 million uk private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million tv licences in all premises in force as of 2010. this television license fee is set by the government, but the bbc is not answerable to or controlled by the government.\\nthe two main bbc tv channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing, despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via freeview. the licence that funds the seven advertising-free bbc tv channels costs £147 a year (about us$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of tv sets owned; the price is reduced by two-thirds if only black and white television is received. when the same sporting event has been presented on both bbc and commercial channels, the bbc always attracts the lion\\'s share of the audience, indicating that viewers prefer to watch tv uninterrupted by advertising.\\nother than internal promotional material, the australian broadcasting corporation (abc) carries no advertising; it is banned under the abc act 1983. the abc receives its funding from the australian government every three years. in the 2014/15 federal budget, the abc received a$1.11 billion. the funds provide for the abc\\'s television, radio, online, and international outputs. the abc also receives funds from its many abc shops across australia. although funded by the australian government, the editorial independence of the abc is ensured through law.\\nin france, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax (\"la redevance audiovisuelle\").in japan, nhk is paid for by license fees (known in japanese as reception fee (受信料, jushinryō)). the broadcast law that governs nhk\\'s funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive nhk is required to pay. the fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of okinawa prefecture.\\n\\n\\n=== broadcast programming ===\\n\\nbroadcast programming, or tv listings in the united kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of tv programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters\\' programs.\\n\\n\\n== social aspects ==\\n\\ntelevision has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. there are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as media violence. current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation. several studies have found that educational television has many advantages. the article \"the good things about television\" argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.\\n\\n\\n=== consumption ===\\n\\n\\n== negative impacts ==\\nwith high lead content in crts and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which (lcds) use lamps which contain mercury, there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions. related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from crts. further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices\\' increasing electrical energy requirements.a 2017 study in the journal of human resources found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. this effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. the article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\n\\n\\n== further reading ==\\nabramson, albert (2003). the history of television, 1942 to 2000. jefferson, nc, and london:

              "       ['mexico city, or the city of mexico (spanish: ciudad de méxico, american spanish: [sjuˈða(ð) ðe ˈmexiko] (listen); abbreviated as cdmx, nahuatl languages: āltepētl mēxihco), is the capital of mexico and the most populous city in north america. it is one of the most important cultural and financial centres in the world. it is located in the valley of mexico (valle de méxico), a large valley in the high plateaus in the center of mexico, at an altitude of 2,240 meters (7,350 ft). the city has 16 alcaldías, formerly known as boroughs.\\nthe 2009 population for the city proper was approximately 8.84 million people, with a land area of 1,485 square kilometers (573 sq mi). according to the most recent definition agreed upon by the federal and state governments, the population of greater mexico city is 21.3 million, which makes it the second largest metropolitan area of the western hemisphere, the eleventh-largest agglomeration (2017), and the largest spanish-speaking city in the world.greater mexico city has a gdp of $411 billion in 2011, making greater mexico city one of the most productive urban areas in the world. the city was responsible for generating 15.8% of mexico\\'s gdp, and the metropolitan area accounted for about 22% of total national gdp. if it were an independent country, in 2013, mexico city would be the fifth-largest economy in latin america, five times as large as costa rica and about the same size as peru.mexico\\'s capital is both the oldest capital city in the americas and one of two founded by indigenous people, the other being quito, ecuador. the city was originally built on an island of lake texcoco by the aztecs in 1325 as tenochtitlan, which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of tenochtitlan and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the spanish urban standards. in 1524, the municipality of mexico city was established, known as méxico tenochtitlán, and as of 1585, it was officially known as ciudad de méxico (mexico city). mexico city was the political, administrative, and financial center of a major part of the spanish colonial empire. after independence from spain was achieved, the federal district was created in 1824.\\nafter years of demanding greater political autonomy, residents were finally given the right to elect both a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral legislative assembly by election in 1997. ever since, the left-wing party of the democratic revolution (prd) has controlled both of them. the city has several progressive policies, such as abortion on demand, a limited form of euthanasia, no-fault divorce, and same-sex marriage.\\non 29 january 2016, it ceased to be the federal district (spanish: distrito federal or d.f.) and is now officially known as ciudad de méxico (or cdmx), with a greater degree of autonomy. a clause in the constitution of mexico, however, prevents it from becoming a state within the mexican federation, as it is the seat of power in the country, unless the capital of the country were to be relocated elsewhere.\\n\\n\\n== history ==\\n\\nthe oldest signs of human occupation in mexico city area are those of the \"peñon woman\" and others found in san bartolo atepehuacan (gustavo a. madero), and were believed to correspond to the lower cenolithic period (9500-7000 bc). however, recent studies place its age at 12,700 years, she is one of the americas\\' oldest human remains, and its origin due to its mitochondrial dna, can be asian, or caucasian having an appearance like western european whites, or australian.\\nthe area was the destination of the migrations of the teochichimecas during the 8th and 13th centuries, peoples that would give rise to the toltec, and mexica (aztecs) cultures. the latter arrived around the 14th century to settle first on the shores of the lake.\\n\\n\\n=== aztec period ===\\n\\nthe city of mexico-tenochtitlan was founded by the mexica people in 1325. the old mexica city that is now simply referred to as tenochtitlan was built on an island in the center of the inland lake system of the valley of mexico, which it shared with a smaller city-state called tlatelolco. according to legend, the mexicas\\' principal god, huitzilopochtli, indicated the site where they were to build their home by presenting a golden eagle perched on a prickly pear devouring a rattlesnake.between 1325 and 1521, tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states around lake texcoco and in the valley of mexico. when the spaniards arrived, the aztec empire had reached much of mesoamerica, touching both the gulf of mexico and the pacific ocean.\\n\\n\\n=== spanish conquest ===\\n\\nafter landing in veracruz, spanish explorer hernán cortés advanced upon tenochtitlan with the aid of many of the other native peoples,\\narriving there on 8 november 1519. cortés and his men marched along the causeway leading into the city from iztapalapa, and the city\\'s ruler, moctezuma ii, greeted the spaniards; they exchanged gifts, but the camaraderie did not last long.\\ncortés put moctezuma under house arrest, hoping to rule through him.tensions increased until, on the night of 30 june 1520 – during a struggle known as \"la noche triste\" – the aztecs rose up against the spanish intrusion and managed to capture or drive out the europeans and their tlaxcalan allies. cortés regrouped at tlaxcala. the aztecs thought the spaniards were permanently gone, and they elected a new king, cuitláhuac, but he soon died; the next king was cuauhtémoc.cortés began a siege of tenochtitlan in may 1521. for three months, the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of smallpox brought by the europeans. cortés and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and slowly fought their way through the city. cuauhtémoc surrendered in august 1521. the spaniards practically razed tenochtitlan during the final siege of the conquest.\\n\\n\\n=== rebuilding ===\\ncortés first settled in coyoacán, but decided to rebuild the aztec site to erase all traces of the old order. he did not establish a territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the spanish crown. the first spanish viceroy arrived in mexico city fourteen years later. by that time, the city had again become a city-state, having power that extended far beyond its borders.although the spanish preserved tenochtitlan\\'s basic layout, they built catholic churches over the old aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves. tenochtitlan was renamed \"mexico\" because the spanish found the word easier to pronounce.\\n\\n\\n=== growth of colonial mexico city ===\\n\\nthe city had been the capital of the aztec empire and in the colonial era, mexico city became the capital of new spain. the viceroy of mexico or vice-king lived in the viceregal palace on the main square or zócalo. the mexico city metropolitan cathedral, the seat of the archbishopric of new spain, was constructed on another side of the zócalo, as was the archbishop\\'s palace, and across from it the building housing the city council or ayuntamiento of the city.\\na late seventeenth-century painting of the zócalo by cristóbal de villalpando depicts the main square, which had been the old aztec ceremonial center. the existing central place of the aztecs was effectively and permanently transformed to the ceremonial center and seat of power during the colonial period, and remains to this day in modern mexico, the central place of the nation.\\nthe rebuilding of the city after the siege of tenochtitlan was accomplished by the abundant indigenous labor in the surrounding area. franciscan friar toribio de benavente motolinia, one of the twelve apostles of mexico who arrived in new spain in 1524, described the rebuilding of the city as one of the afflictions or plagues of the early period:\\n\\nthe seventh plague was the construction of the great city of mexico, which, during the early years used more people than in the construction of jerusalem. the crowds of laborers were so numerous that one could hardly move in the streets and causeways, although they are very wide. many died from being crushed by beams, or falling from high places, or in tearing down old buildings for new ones. preconquest tenochtitlan was built in the center of the inland lake system, with the city reachable by canoe and by wide causeways to the mainland. the causeways were rebuilt under spanish rule with indigenous labor.\\ncolonial spanish cities were constructed on a grid pattern, if no geographical obstacle prevented it. in mexico city, the zócalo (main square) was the central place from which the grid was then built outward. the spanish lived in the area closest to the main square in what was known as the traza, in orderly, well laid-out streets. indian residences were outside that exclusive zone and houses were haphazardly located.spaniards sought to keep indians separate from spaniards but since the zócalo was a center of commerce for indians, they were a constant presence in the central area, so strict segregation was never enforced. at intervals zócalo was where major celebrations took place as well as executions. it was also the site of two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624, the other in 1692.\\n\\nthe city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake\\'s waters. as the depth of the lake water fluctuated, mexico city was subject to periodic flooding. a major labor draft, the desagüe, compelled thousands of indians over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city\\'s streets. by draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. however, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indian cultivation close to the capital.the 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.\\neconomically, mexico city prospered as a result of trade. unlike brazil or peru, mexico had easy contact with both the atlantic and pacific worlds. although the spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.the concept of nobility flourished in new spain in a way not seen in other parts of the americas. spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. in the ensuing centuries, possession of a noble title in mexico did not mean one exercised great political power, for one\\'s power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not. the concept of nobility in mexico was not political but rather a very conservative spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in new spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. the craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to mexico city\\'s nickname of \"the city of palaces\" given by alexander von humboldt.the grito de dolores (\"cry of dolores\"), also known as el grito de la independencia (\"cry of independence\"), marked the beginning of the mexican war of independence. the battle of guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred four days later. after a decade of war, mexico\\'s independence from spain was effectively declared in the declaration of independence of the mexican empire on 27 september 1821. agustín de iturbide is proclaimed emperor of the first mexican empire by congress, crowned in the cathedral of mexico. unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of mexico.the mexican federal district was established by the new government and by the signing of their new constitution, where the concept of a federal district was adapted from the united states constitution. before this designation, mexico city had served as the seat of government for both the state of mexico and the nation as a whole. texcoco de mora and then toluca became the capital of the state of mexico.\\n\\n\\n=== the battle of mexico city in the u.s.–mexican war of 1847 ===\\n\\nduring the 19th century, mexico city was the center stage of all the political disputes of the country. it was the imperial capital on two occasions (1821-1823 and 1864-1867), and of two federalist states and two centralist states that followed innumerable coups d\\'états in the space of half a century before the triumph of the liberals after the reform war. it was also the objective of one of the two french invasions to mexico (1861-1867), and occupied for a year by american troops in the framework of the mexican–american war (1847-1848).\\nthe battle for mexico city was the series of engagements from 8 to 15 september 1847, in the general vicinity of mexico city during the u.s. mexican war. included are major actions at the battles of molino del rey and chapultepec, culminating with the fall of mexico city. the u.s. army under winfield scott scored a major success that ended the war. the american invasion into the federal district was first resisted during the battle of churubusco on 8 august, where the saint patrick\\'s battalion, which was composed primarily of catholic irish and german immigrants but also canadians, english, french, italians, poles, scots, spaniards, swiss, and mexicans, fought for the mexican cause, repelling the american attacks. after defeating the saint patrick\\'s battalion, the mexican–american war came to a close after the united states deployed combat units deep into mexico resulting in the capture of mexico city and veracruz by the u.s. army\\'s 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th divisions. the invasion culminated with the storming of chapultepec castle in the city itself.during this battle, on 13 september, the 4th division, under john a. quitman, spearheaded the attack against chapultepec and carried the castle. future confederate generals george e. pickett and james longstreet participated in the attack. serving in the mexican defense were the cadets later immortalized as los niños héroes (the \"boy heroes\"). the mexican forces fell back from chapultepec and retreated within the city. attacks on the belén and san cosme gates came afterwards. the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo was signed in what is now the far north of the city.\\n\\n\\n=== porfirian era (1876–1911) ===\\n\\nevents such as the mexican–american war, the french intervention and the reform war left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow, especially during the rule of president porfirio díaz. during this time the city developed a modern infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation systems and communication systems. however the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest of the country languished in poverty.\\nunder the rule of porfirio díaz, mexico city experienced a massive transformation. díaz\\'s goal was to create a city which could rival the great european cities. he and his government came to the conclusion that they would use paris as a model, while still containing remnants of amerindian and hispanic elements. this style of mexican-french fusion architecture became colloquially known as porfirian architecture. porfirian architecture became very influenced by paris\\' haussmannization.\\nduring this era of porfirian rule, the city underwent an extensive modernization. many spanish colonial style buildings were destroyed, replaced by new much larger porfirian institutions and many outlying rural zones were transformed into urban or industrialized districts with most having electrical, gas and sewage utilities by 1908. while the initial focus was on developing modern hospitals, schools, factories and massive public works, perhaps the most long-lasting effects of the porfirian modernization were creation of the colonia roma area and the development of reforma avenue. many of mexico city\\'s major attractions and landmarks were built during this era in this style.\\ndiaz\\'s plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or rebuilt in the porfirian/french style of the colonia roma; but the mexican revolution began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition, with many projects being left half-completed. one of the best examples of this is the monument to the mexican revolution. originally the monument was to be the main dome of diaz\\'s new senate hall, but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed, this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many mexicans that the porfirian era was over once and for all and as such, it was turned into a monument to victory over diaz.\\n\\n\\n=== mexican revolution (1910–1920) ===\\n\\nthe capital escaped the worst of the violence of the ten-year conflict of the mexican revolution. the most significant episode of this period for the city was the february 1913 la decena trágica (\"the ten tragic days\"), when forces counter to the elected government of francisco i. madero staged a successful coup. the center of the city was subjected to artillery attacks from the army stronghold of the ciudadela or citadel, with significant civilian casualties and the undermining of confidence in the madero government. victoriano huerta, chief general of the federal army, saw a chance to take power, forcing madero and pino suarez to sign resignations. the two were murdered later while on their way to lecumberri prison. huerta\\'s ouster in july 1914 saw the entry of the armies of pancho villa and emiliano zapata, but the city did not experience violence. huerta had abandoned the capital and the conquering armies marched in. venustiano carranza\\'s constitutionalist faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.\\n\\n\\n=== 20th century to present ===\\n\\nthe history of the rest of the 20th century to the present focuses on the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences. in 1900, the population of mexico city was about 500,000. the city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century and then began to grow upwards in the 1950s, with the torre latinoamericana becoming the city\\'s first skyscraper. the 1968 olympic games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities.in 1969 the metro system was inaugurated.\\nexplosive growth in the population of the city started in the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the federal district into the neighboring state of mexico, especially to the north, northwest, and northeast. between 1960 and 1980 the city\\'s population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.in 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in mexico were located in mexico city. under relentless growth, the mexico city government could barely keep up with services. villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city\\'s problems. with no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles. this caused serious air pollution in mexico city and water pollution problems, as well as subsidence due to overextraction of groundwater. air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.\\nthe autocratic government that ruled mexico city since the revolution was tolerated, mostly because of the continued economic expansion since world war ii. this was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of an unknown number of protesting students in tlatelolco.three years later, a demonstration in the maestros avenue, organized by former members of the 1968 student movement, was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called \"los halcones\", composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the u.s.\\n\\non thursday, 19 september 1985, at 7:19 am cst, mexico city was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 on the richter magnitude scale. although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in asia and other parts of latin america, it proved to be a disaster politically for the one-party government. the government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well.however, the last straw may have been the controversial elections of 1988. that year, the presidency was set between the p.r.i.\\'s candidate, carlos salinas de gortari, and a coalition of left-wing parties led by cuauhtémoc cárdenas, son of the former president lázaro cárdenas. the counting system \"fell\" because coincidentally the light went out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was salinas, even though cárdenas had the upper hand.\\nas a result of the fraudulent election, cárdenas became a member of the party of the democratic revolution. discontent over the election eventually led cuauhtémoc cárdenas to become the first elected mayor of mexico city in 1997. cárdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. he resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency.\\n\\n\\n== geography ==\\nmexico city is located in the valley of mexico, sometimes called the basin of mexico. this valley is located in the trans-mexican volcanic belt in the high plateaus of south-central mexico. it has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet). this valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.mexico city primarily rests on what was lake texcoco. seismic activity is frequent there. lake texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed\\'s heavily saturated clay. this soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called groundwater-related subsidence. since the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as nine meters (30 feet) in some areas. this sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the summer. the entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city\\'s remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of milpa alta, tlalpan and xochimilco.\\n\\n\\n== climate ==\\n\\nmexico city has a subtropical highland climate (köppen climate classification cwb), due to its tropical location but high elevation. the lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of iztapalapa, iztacalco, venustiano carranza and the east portion of gustavo a. madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of tlalpan and milpa alta, a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of ajusco.\\nthe average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16 °c (54 to 61 °f), depending on the altitude of the borough. the temperature is rarely below 3 °c (37 °f) or above 30 °c (86 °f). at the tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was −4.4 °c (24 °f) on 13 february 1960, and the highest temperature on record was 33.9 °c (93 °f) on 9 may 1998.overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.\\nsnow falls in the city very rarely, although somewhat more often in nearby mountain tops. throughout its history, the central valley of mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year—except 1880—recorded snowfalls) mostly lake-effect snow. the effects of the draining of lake texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 february 1907. since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 february 1920; snow flurries on 14 march 1940; and on 12 january 1967, when 8 centimetres (3 in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record. the 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of deep drainage system that resulted in the total draining of what was left of lake texcoco. after the disappearance of lake texcoco, snow has never fallen again over mexico city.the region of the valley of mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. the weak winds of these systems do not allow for the dispersion, outside the basin, of the air pollutants which are produced by the 50,000 industries and 4 million vehicles operating in and around the metropolitan area.the area receives about 820 millimeters (32 in) of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from may through october with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year. the area has two main seasons. the wet humid summer runs from may to october when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea, the wettest month being july. the cool sunny winter runs from november to april, when the air is relatively drier, the driest month being december. this season is subdivided into a cold winter period and a warm spring period. the cold period spans from november to february, when polar air masses push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry. the warm period extends from march to may when subtropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain to form.\\n\\n\\n== environment ==\\n\\noriginally much of the valley lay beneath the waters of lake texcoco, a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes. the aztecs built dikes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in chinampas and to prevent recurrent floods. these dikes were destroyed during the siege of tenochtitlan, and during colonial times the spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods. only a small section of the original lake remains, located outside mexico city, in the municipality of atenco, state of mexico.\\narchitects teodoro gonzález de león and alberto kalach along with a group of mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for recovering the city of lakes. if approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the valley of mexico, the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.\\n\\n\\n=== pollution ===\\n\\nby the 1990s mexico city had become infamous as one of the world\\'s most polluted cities; however, the city has become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. by 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were nearly three times lower than in 1992. the levels of signature pollutants in mexico city are similar to those of los angeles. despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond who-defined safe limits.to clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides. when the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the a day without a car program to two days of the week. the government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels. the introduction of metrobús bus rapid transit and the ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.\\n\\n\\n== politics ==\\n\\n\\n=== political structure ===\\n\\nthe acta constitutiva de la federación of 31 january 1824, and the federal constitution of 4 october 1824, fixed the political and administrative organization of the united mexican states after the mexican war of independence. in addition, section xxviii of article 50 gave the new congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located. this location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. the two main candidates to become the capital were mexico city and querétaro.due in large part to the persuasion of representative servando teresa de mier, mexico city was chosen because it was the center of the country\\'s population and history, even though querétaro was closer to the center geographically. the choice was official on 18 november 1824, and congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the zocalo. this area was then separated from the state of mexico, forcing that state\\'s government to move from the palace of the inquisition (now museum of mexican medicine) in the city to texcoco. this area did not include the population centers of the towns of coyoacán, xochimilco, mexicaltzingo and tlalpan, all of which remained as part of the state of mexico.in 1854 president antonio lópez de santa anna enlarged the area of mexico city almost eightfold from the original 220 to 1,700 km2 (80 to 660 sq mi), annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (the mexican–american war had just been fought.) the last changes to the limits of mexico city were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 (571 sq mi) by adjusting the southern border with the state of morelos. by that time, the total number of municipalities within mexico city was twenty-two.\\nwhile mexico city was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor, the municipalities within it were autonomous, and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century. in 1903, porfirio díaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the federal district. eventually, in december 1928, the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the federal district. in place of the municipalities, the federal district was divided into one \"central department\" and 13 delegaciones (boroughs) administered directly by the government of the federal district. the central department was integrated by the former municipalities of mexico city, tacuba, tacubaya and mixcoac.\\nin 1941, the general anaya borough was merged with the central department, which was then renamed \"mexico city\" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality). from 1941 to 1970, the federal district comprised twelve delegaciones and mexico city. in 1970, mexico city was split into four different delegaciones: cuauhtémoc, miguel hidalgo, venustiano carranza and benito juárez, increasing the number of delegaciones to 16. since then, the whole federal district, whose delegaciones had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered de facto a synonym of mexico city.the lack of a de jure stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. in 1993, the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the constitution of mexico; mexico city and the federal district were stated to be the same entity. the amendment was later introduced into the second article of the statute of government of the federal district.on 29 january 2016, mexico city ceased to be the federal district (spanish: distrito federal or d.f.). the former \"distrito federal\" is now officially known as \"ciudad de méxico\" (or \"cdmx\"). mexico city is now in transition to become the country\\'s 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. because of a clause in the mexican constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.mexico city, being the seat of the powers of the union, belongs not to any particular state but to all of them. therefore, the president, representing the federation, used to designate the head of government of the federal district (today the head of the government of mexico city), sometimes called outside mexico as the \"mayor\" of mexico city. in the 1980s, the dramatic increase in population of the previous decades, the inherent political inconsistencies of the system, and dissatisfaction with the inadequate response of the federal government after the 1985 earthquake made residents begin to request political and administrative autonomy to manage their local affairs. some political groups even proposed that the federal district be converted into the 32nd state of the federation.\\nin response to the demands, mexico city received a greater degree of autonomy, with the 1987 elaboration the first statute of government (estatuto de gobierno) and the creation of an assembly of representatives. in the 1990s, this autonomy was further expanded, and since 1997, residents can directly elect the head of government of the federal district and the representatives of a unicameral legislative assembly, which succeeded the previous assembly, by popular vote.\\nthe first elected head of government was cuauhtémoc cárdenas. he resigned in 1999 to run in the 2000 presidential elections and designated rosario robles to succeed him, who became the first woman, elected or otherwise, to govern mexico city. in 2000, andrés manuel lópez obrador was elected, and he resigned in 2005 to run in the 2006 presidential elections; alejandro encinas was designated by the legislative assembly to finish the term. in 2006, marcelo ebrard was elected to serve until 2012.\\nthe city has a statute of government, and as of its ratification on 31 january 2017, a constitution, similar to the states of the union. as part of the recent changes in autonomy, the budget is administered locally; it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the legislative assembly. nonetheless, it is the congress of the union that sets the ceiling to internal and external public debt issued by the city government.according to the 44th article of the mexican constitution, if the powers of the union move to another city, mexico city would become a new state, the \"state of the valley of mexico\", with the new limits set by the congress of the union.\\n\\n\\n=== elections and government ===\\nin 2012, elections were held for the post of head of government and the representatives of the legislative assembly. heads of government are elected for a six-year period without the possibility of re-election. traditionally, the position has been considered as the second most important executive office in the country.the legislative assembly of mexico city is formed, as it is the case for state legislatures in mexico, by both single-seat and proportional seats, making it a system of parallel voting. mexico city is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by the plurality voting system, locally called \"uninominal deputies\". mexico city, as a whole, is a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives, elected by proportional representation, with open-party lists, locally called \"plurinominal deputies\".\\neven though proportionality is supposed to prevent a party from being overrepresented, several restrictions apply in the assignation of the seats. no party can have more than 63% of all seats, both uninominal and plurinominal. in the 2006 elections, the prd got the absolute majority in the direct uninominal elections, securing 34 of the 40 fpp seats. as such, the prd was not assigned any plurinominal seat to comply with the law that prevents over-representation. the overall composition of the legislative assembly is:\\n\\nthe politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in mexico city since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country, whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the legislative assembly. the legislative assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy. in december 2009, the then federal district became the first city in latin america and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.\\n\\n\\n=== boroughs and neighborhoods ===\\n\\nfor administrative purposes, the city is divided into 16 \"alcadias\", or boroughs (formerly \"delegaciones\"). while they are not fully equivalent to municipalities, the boroughs have gained significant autonomy, and since 2000, their heads of government have been elected directly by plurality (they had been appointed by the head of government of the federal district). since mexico city is organized entirely as a federal district, most of the city services are provided or organized by the city government, not by the boroughs themselves; in the constituent states, such services would be provided by the municipalities. the boroughs of mexico city with their 2010 populations are:\\nthe boroughs are composed by hundreds of colonias or neighborhoods, which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation. the historic center, in the borough of cuauhtémoc, is the oldest part of the city (along with some other, formerly separate colonial towns such as coyoacán and san ángel), some of the buildings dating back to the 16th century. other well-known central neighborhoods include condesa, known for its art deco architecture and its restaurant scene; colonia roma, a beaux arts neighborhood and artistic and culinary hot-spot, the zona rosa, formerly the center of nightlife and restaurants, now reborn as the center of the lgbt and korean-mexican communities; and tepito and la lagunilla, known for their local working-class folklore and large flea markets. santa maría la ribera and san rafael are the latest neighborhoods of magnificent porfiriato architecture seeing the first signs of gentrification.\\nwest of the historic center (centro histórico) along paseo de la reforma are many of the city\\'s wealthiest neighborhoods such as polanco, lomas de chapultepec, bosques de las lomas, santa fe, and (in the state of mexico) interlomas, which are also the city\\'s most important areas of class a office space, corporate headquarters, skyscrapers and shopping malls. nevertheless, some areas of lower-income colonias are right next to rich neighborhoods, particularly in the case of santa fe.\\nthe south of the city is home to some other high-income neighborhoods such as colonia del valle and jardines del pedregal and the formerly separate colonial towns of coyoacán, san ángel, and san jerónimo. along avenida insurgentes from paseo de la reforma, near the center, south past the world trade center and unam university towards the periférico ring road, is another important corridor of corporate office space. the far-southern boroughs of xochimilco and tláhuac have a significant rural population, with milpa alta being entirely rural.\\neast of the center are mostly lower-income areas with some middle-class neighborhoods such as jardín balbuena. urban sprawl continues further east for many miles into the state of mexico, including ciudad nezahualcoyotl, now increasingly middle-class, but once full of informal settlements. such slums are still found on the eastern edges of the metropolitan area in the chalco area.\\nnorth of the historic center, azcapotzalco and gustavo a. madero have important industrial centers and neighborhoods that range from established middle-class colonias such as claveria and lindavista to huge low-income housing areas that share hillsides with adjacent municipalities in the state of mexico. in recent years, much of northern mexico city\\'s industry has moved to nearby municipalities in the state of mexico. northwest of mexico city itself is ciudad satélite, a vast middle to upper-middle-class residential and business area.\\nthe human development index report of 2005 shows that there were three boroughs with a very high human development index, 12 with a high hdi value (9 above .85) and one with a medium hdi value (almost high). benito juárez borough had the highest hdi of the country (0.9510) followed by miguel hidalgo which came up fourth nationally with a hdi of (0.9189) and coyoacán was fifth nationally, with a hdi of (0.9169). cuajimalpa (15th), cuauhtémoc (23rd) and azcapotzalco (25th) also had very high values of respectively 0.8994, 0.8922, and 0.8915.\\nin contrast, the boroughs of xochimilco (172nd), tláhuac (177th), and iztapalapa (183rd) presented the lowest hdi values of mexico city with values of 0.8481, 0.8473, and 0.8464 respectively, which are still in the global high-hdi range. the only borough that did not have a high hdi was that of rural milpa alta, which had a \"medium\" hdi of 0.7984, far below all of the other boroughs (627th nationally, the rest being in the top 200). mexico city\\'s hdi for the 2005 report was of 0.9012 (very high), and its 2010 value of 0.9225 (very high), or (by newer methodology) 0.8307, was mexico\\'s highest.\\n\\n\\n=== metropolitan area ===\\n\\ngreater mexico city is formed by mexico city, 60 municipalities from the state of mexico and one from the state of hidalgo. greater mexico city is the largest metropolitan area in mexico and the area with the highest population density. as of 2009, 21,163,226 people live in this urban agglomeration, of which 8,841,916 live in mexico city proper. in terms of population, the biggest municipalities that are part of greater mexico city (excluding mexico city proper) are:\\necatepec de morelos (pop. 1,658,806)\\nnezahualcóyotl (pop. 1,109,363)\\nnaucalpan (pop. 833,782)\\ntlalnepantla de baz (pop. 664,160)\\nchimalhuacán (pop. 602,079)\\ncuautitlán izcalli (pop. 532,973)\\natizapan de zaragoza (pop. 489,775)\\nixtapaluca (pop. 467,630)the above municipalities are located in the state of mexico but are part of the greater mexico city area. approximately 75% (10 million) of the state of méxico\\'s population live in municipalities that are part of greater mexico city\\'s conurbation.\\ngreater mexico city was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. since then, and through a policy of decentralization in order to reduce the environmental pollutants of the growing conurbation, the annual rate of growth of the agglomeration has decreased, and it is lower than that of the other four largest metropolitan areas (namely greater guadalajara, greater monterrey, greater puebla and greater toluca) even though it is still positive.the net migration rate of mexico city proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative, which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of mexico. in addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of greater mexico city.\\n\\n\\n== law enforcement ==\\n\\nthe secretariat of public security of mexico city (secretaría de seguridad pública de la ciudad de méxico – ssp) manages a combined force of over 90,000 officers in mexico city. the ssp is charged with maintaining public order and safety in the heart of mexico city. the historic district is also roamed by tourist police, aiming to orient and serve tourists. these horse-mounted agents dress in traditional uniforms.\\nthe investigative judicial police of mexico city (policía judicial de la ciudad de méxico – pjcdmx) is organized under the office of the attorney general of mexico city (the procuraduría general de justicia de la ciudad de méxico). the pgjcdmx maintains 16 precincts (delegaciones) with an estimated 3,500 judicial police, 1,100 investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys (agentes del ministerio público), and nearly 1,000 criminology experts or specialists (peritos).\\nbetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in mexico city; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\". under policies enacted by mayor marcelo ebrard between 2009 and 2011, mexico city underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. mexico city has one of the world\\'s highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.\\nsince 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%. political scientist markus-michael müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. he sees punishment \"related to the growing politicisation of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalisation of the people living at the margins of urban society, in particular those who work in the city\\'s informal economy.\"\\n\\n\\n=== femicides and violence against women ===\\nin 2016, the incidence of femicides was 3.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, the national average being 4.2. a 2015 city government report found that two of three women over the age of 15 in the capital suffered some form of violence. in addition to street harassment, one of the places where women in mexico city live in violence is public transport. annually the metro of mexico city receives 300 complaints of sexual harassment.\\n\\n\\n== health ==\\n\\nmexico city is home to some of the best private hospitals in the country, including hospital ángeles, hospital abc and médica sur. the national public healthcare institution for private-sector employees, imss, has its largest facilities in mexico city—including the national medical center and the la raza medical center—and has an annual budget of over 6 billion pesos. the imss and other public health institutions, including the issste (public sector employees\\' social security institute) and the national health ministry (ssa) maintain large specialty facilities in the city. these include the national institutes of cardiology, nutrition, psychiatry, oncology, pediatrics, rehabilitation, among others.\\nthe world bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. they have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter, which reduces the emissions released. trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (lpg). also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion. it currently has over 201 km (125 mi) of track and carries over 5 million people every day. fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women. due to these initiatives and others, the air quality in mexico city has begun to improve; it is currently cleaner than it was in 1991, when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year.\\n\\n\\n== economy ==\\n\\nmexico city is one of the most important economic hubs in latin america. the city proper produces 15.8% of the country\\'s gross domestic product. according to a study conducted by pwc, mexico city had a gdp of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in latin america. mexico city alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.\\nmexico city is the greatest contributor to the country\\'s industrial gdp (15.8%) and also the greatest contributor to the country\\'s gdp in the service sector (25.3%). due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of mexico city in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country. mexico city has one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies and its gdp is set to double from 2008 to 2020.in 2002, mexico city had a human development index score of 0.915, identical to that of south korea.\\nthe top twelve percent of gdp per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of us$98,517 in 2007. the high spending power of mexico city inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods.\\nthe economic reforms of president carlos salinas de gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. he also signed the north american free trade agreement (nafta). this led to decentralization and a shift in mexico city\\'s economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the state of mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. by contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.'],\n",
              "       ['leonardo di ser piero da vinci (italian: [leoˈnardo di ˌsɛr ˈpjɛːro da (v)ˈvintʃi] (listen); 14/15 april 1452 – 2 may 1519), known as leonardo da vinci (english:  lee-ə-nar-doh də vin-chee, lee-oh-, lay-oh-), was an italian polymath of the renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, paleontology, and cartography. he has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time (despite perhaps only 15 of his paintings having survived).born out of wedlock to a notary, piero da vinci, and a peasant woman, caterina, in vinci, in the region of florence, italy, leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned italian painter andrea del verrocchio. much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of ludovico il moro in milan, and he later worked in rome, bologna and venice. he spent his last three years in france, where he died in 1519.\\nleonardo is renowned primarily as a painter. the mona lisa is the most famous of his works and the most popular portrait ever made. the last supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his vitruvian man drawing is regarded as a cultural icon as well. salvator mundi was sold for a world record $450.3 million at a christie\\'s auction in new york, 15 november 2017, the highest price ever paid for a work of art. leonardo\\'s paintings and preparatory drawings—together with his notebooks, which contain sketches, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting—compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary michelangelo.although he had no formal academic training, many historians and scholars regard leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"universal genius\" or \"renaissance man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination.\" he is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived. according to art historian helen gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote.\" scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. he conceptualized flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull. relatively few of his designs were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the renaissance. some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. he is also sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter, and tank. he made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, geology, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.\\n\\n\\n== life ==\\nleonardo was born out of wedlock to notary piero da vinci and a peasant woman named caterina in vinci in the region of florence, and he was educated in the studio of florentine painter andrea del verrocchio. much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of ludovico il moro in milan. he later worked in rome, bologna, and venice, and he spent his last years in france at the home awarded to him by francis i.\\n\\n\\n=== early life ===\\n\\nleonardo was born on 14/15 april 1452 in the tuscan hill town of vinci, in the lower valley of the arno river in the territory of the medici-ruled republic of florence. he was the out-of-wedlock son of messer piero fruosino di antonio da vinci, a wealthy florentine legal notary, and a peasant named caterina, identified as caterina buti del vacca and more recently as caterina di meo lippi by historian martin kemp. there have been many theories regarding leonardo\\'s mother\\'s identity, including that she was a slave of foreign origin or an impoverished local youth. leonardo had no surname in the modern sense—da vinci simply meaning \"of vinci\"; his full birth name was lionardo di ser piero da vinci, meaning \"leonardo, (son) of ser piero from vinci.\"leonardo spent his first years in the hamlet of anchiano in the home of his mother, and from at least 1457 lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle in the small town of vinci. his father had married a 16-year-old girl named albiera amadori, who loved leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. in 1468, when leonardo was 16, his father married again to 20-year-old francesca lanfredini, who also died without children. piero\\'s legitimate heirs were born from his third wife margherita di guglielmo, who gave birth to six children, and his fourth and final wife, lucrezia cortigiani, who bore him another six heirs.\\nin all, leonardo had 12 half-siblings, who were much younger than he was (the last was born when leonardo was 40 years old) and with whom he had very little contact.leonardo received an informal education in latin, geometry and mathematics. in later life, leonardo recorded few distinct childhood incidents. one was of a kite coming to his cradle and opening his mouth with its tail; he regarded this as an omen of his writing on the subject. the second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside. he also seems to have remembered some of his childhood observations of water, writing and crossing out the name of his hometown in one of his notebooks on the formation of rivers.leonardo\\'s early life has been the subject of historical conjecture. vasari, the 16th-century biographer of renaissance painters, tells a story of leonardo as a very young man: a local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that ser piero have it painted for him. leonardo, inspired by the story of medusa, responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that his father bought a different shield to give to the peasant and sold leonardo\\'s to a florentine art dealer for 100 ducats, who in turn sold it to the duke of milan.\\n\\n\\n=== verrocchio\\'s workshop ===\\n\\nin the mid-1460s, leonardo\\'s family moved to florence, and around the age of 14, he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of verrocchio, who was the leading florentine painter and sculptor of his time. leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years. other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include ghirlandaio, perugino, botticelli, and lorenzo di credi. leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and wood-work, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.much of the painting in verrocchio\\'s workshop was done by his employees. according to vasari, leonardo collaborated with verrocchio on his the baptism of christ, painting the young angel holding jesus\\' robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master\\'s that verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be an apocryphal story. close examination reveals areas of the work that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera, using the new technique of oil paint, including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream, and much of the figure of jesus, bearing witness to the hand of leonardo. leonardo may have been the model for two works by verrocchio: the bronze statue of david in the bargello, and the archangel raphael in tobias and the angel.by 1472, at the age of 20, leonardo qualified as a master in the guild of saint luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate and live with him. leonardo\\'s earliest known dated work is a 1473 pen-and-ink drawing of the arno valley, which has been cited as the first \"pure\" landscape in the occident. according to vasari, the young leonardo was the first to suggest making the arno river a navigable channel between florence and pisa.\\n\\n\\n=== professional life ===\\n\\nin january 1478, leonardo received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the chapel of st. bernard in the palazzo vecchio, an indication of his independence from verrocchio\\'s studio. one anonymous writer claims that in 1480, leonardo was living with the medici and often worked in the garden of the piazza san marco, florence, where a neoplatonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers organized by the medici met. in march 1481, he received a commission from the monks of san donato in scopeto for the adoration of the magi.\\nneither of these initial commissions were completed, being abandoned when leonardo went to offer his services to duke of milan ludovico sforza. in 1482, he casted a silver stringed instrument from a horse\\'s skull and ram horns to bring to sforza, whom he wrote a letter describing the diverse things that he could achieve in the fields of engineering and weapon design, and mentioning that he could paint.\\n\\nleonardo worked in milan from 1482 until 1499. he was commissioned to paint the virgin of the rocks for the confraternity of the immaculate conception and the last supper for the monastery of santa maria delle grazie. in the spring of 1485, leonardo travelled to hungary on behalf of sforza to meet king matthias corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a madonna.\\nleonardo was employed on many other projects for sforza, including the preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions, a drawing and wooden model for a competition to design the cupola for milan cathedral (which he withdrew), and a model for a huge equestrian monument to ludovico\\'s predecessor francesco sforza. this would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the renaissance, donatello\\'s gattamelata in padua and verrocchio\\'s bartolomeo colleoni in venice, and became known as the gran cavallo. leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting, but in november 1494, ludovico gave the bronze to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from charles viii.with ludovico sforza overthrown at the dawn of the second italian war, leonardo, with his assistant salaì and friend, the mathematician luca pacioli, fled milan for venice. there, he was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack. on his return to florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the servite monks at the monastery of santissima annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to vasari, leonardo created the cartoon of the virgin and child with st anne and st john the baptist, a work that won such admiration that \"men and women, young and old\" flocked to see it \"as if they were attending a great festival.\"\\n\\nin cesena in 1502, leonardo entered the service of cesare borgia, the son of pope alexander vi, acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout italy with his patron. leonardo created a map of cesare borgia\\'s stronghold, a town plan of imola in order to win his patronage. maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept. upon seeing it, cesare hired leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. later in the year, leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of chiana valley, tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. he created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.\\nleonardo had left borgia\\'s service and returned to florence by early 1503, where he rejoined the guild of saint luke on 18 october of that year. by this same month, leonardo had begun working on a portrait of lisa del giocondo, the model for the mona lisa, which he would continue working on until his twilight years. in january 1504, he was part of a committee formed to recommend where michelangelo\\'s statue of david should be placed. he then spent two years in florence designing and painting a mural of the battle of anghiari for the signoria, with michelangelo designing its companion piece, the battle of cascina. while in florence, leonardo wrote in the codex atlanticus of the da vinci globe (1504), which proves that he was aware of the discovery of the americas.in 1506, leonardo was summoned to milan by charles ii d\\'amboise, the acting french governor of the city. the council of florence wished leonardo to return promptly to finish the battle of anghiari, but he was given leave at the behest of louis xii, who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits. leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d\\'amboise; a wax model survives and, if genuine, is the only extant example of leonardo\\'s sculpture. leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests. many of leonardo\\'s most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in milan, including bernardino luini, giovanni antonio boltraffio, and marco d\\'oggiono.\\nin 1507, leonardo was in florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father, who had died in 1504. by 1508, leonardo was back in milan, living in his own house in porta orientale in the parish of santa babila.\\n\\n\\n=== old age and death ===\\n\\nin 1512, leonardo was working on plans for an equestrian monument for gian giacomo trivulzio, but this was prevented by an invasion of a confederation of swiss, spanish and venetian forces, which drove the french from milan. leonardo stayed in the city, spending several months in 1513 at the medici\\'s vaprio d\\'adda villa. in march of that year, lorenzo de\\' medici\\'s son giovanni assumed the papacy (as leo x); leonardo went to rome that september, where he was received by the pope\\'s brother giuliano. from september 1513 to 1516, leonardo spent much of his time living in the belvedere courtyard in the apostolic palace, where michelangelo and raphael were both active. leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month, and according to vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver. the pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it impatiently when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish. leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death. he practiced botany in the gardens of vatican city, and was commissioned to make plans for the pope\\'s proposed draining of the pontine marshes. he also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal cords; these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the pope\\'s favor, but was unsuccessful.in october 1515, king francis i of france recaptured milan. leonardo was present at the 19 december meeting of francis i and leo x, which took place in bologna. in 1516, leonardo entered francis\\' service, being given the use of the manor house clos lucé, near the king\\'s residence at the royal château d\\'amboise. being frequently visited by francis, he drew plans for an immense castle town the king intended to erect at romorantin, and made a mechanical lion, which during a pageant walked toward the king and—upon being struck by a wand—opened its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies. leonardo was accompanied during this time by his friend and apprentice, francesco melzi, and supported by a pension totalling 10,000 scudi. at some point, melzi drew a portrait of leonardo; the only others known from his lifetime were a sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of leonardo\\'s studies (c. 1517) and a drawing by giovanni ambrogio figino depicting an elderly leonardo with his right arm assuaged by cloth. the latter, in addition to the record of an october 1517 visit by louis d\\'aragon, confirms an account of leonardo\\'s right hand being paralytic at the age of 65, which may indicate why he left works such as the mona lisa unfinished. he continued to work at some capacity until eventually becoming ill and bedridden for several months.\\n\\nleonardo died at clos lucé on 2 may 1519 at the age of 67, possibly of a stroke. francis i had become a close friend. vasari describes leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed, full of repentance, that \"he had offended against god and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.\" vasari states that in his last days, leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the holy sacrament. vasari also records that the king held leonardo\\'s head in his arms as he died, although this story may be legend rather than fact. in accordance with his will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed leonardo\\'s casket. melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, leonardo\\'s paintings, tools, library and personal effects. leonardo also remembered his other long-time pupil and companion, salaì, and his servant battista di vilussis, who each received half of leonardo\\'s vineyards. his brothers received land, and his serving woman received a fur-lined cloak. on 12 august 1519, leonardo\\'s remains were interred in the collegiate church of saint florentin at the château d\\'amboise.some 20 years after leonardo\\'s death, francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor benvenuto cellini as saying: \"there had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher.\"\\n\\n\\n== relationships and influences ==\\n\\n\\n=== artistic and social background ===\\n\\nflorence at the time of leonardo\\'s youth was the centre of christian humanist thought and culture. leonardo commenced his apprenticeship with verrocchio in 1466, the year that verrocchio\\'s master, the great sculptor donatello, died. the painter uccello, whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a very old man. the painters piero della francesca and filippo lippi, sculptor luca della robbia, and architect and writer leon battista alberti were in their sixties. the successful artists of the next generation were leonardo\\'s teacher verrocchio, antonio del pollaiuolo, and the portrait sculptor mino da fiesole.leonardo\\'s youth was spent in a florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by donatello\\'s contemporaries, masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion; and ghiberti, whose gates of paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. piero della francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. these studies and alberti\\'s treatise de pictura were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on leonardo\\'s own observations and artworks.\\n\\na prevalent tradition in florence was the small altarpiece of the virgin and child. many of these were created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of filippo lippi, verrocchio and the prolific della robbia family. leonardo\\'s early madonnas such as the madonna with a carnation and the benois madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, particularly in the latter in which the virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the christ child at the opposite angle. this compositional theme was to emerge in leonardo\\'s later paintings such as the virgin and child with st. anne.leonardo was a contemporary of botticelli, domenico ghirlandaio and perugino, who were all slightly older than he was. he would have met them at the workshop of verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the academy of the medici. botticelli was a particular favourite of the medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. ghirlandaio and perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. they competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated ghirlandaio\\'s ability to portray the wealthy citizens of florence within large religious frescoes, and perugino\\'s ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.\\nthese three were among those commissioned to paint the walls of the sistine chapel, the work commencing with perugino\\'s employment in 1479. leonardo was not part of this prestigious commission. his first significant commission, the adoration of the magi for the monks of scopeto, was never completed.\\n\\nin 1476, during the time of leonardo\\'s association with verrocchio\\'s workshop, the portinari altarpiece by hugo van der goes arrived in florence, bringing from northern europe new painterly techniques that were to profoundly affect leonardo, ghirlandaio, perugino and others. in 1479, the sicilian painter antonello da messina, who worked exclusively in oils, travelled north on his way to venice, where the leading painter giovanni bellini adopted the technique of oil painting, quickly making it the preferred method in venice. leonardo was also later to visit venice.like the two contemporary architects donato bramante (who designed the belvedere courtyard) and antonio da sangallo the elder, leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, a number of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.leonardo\\'s political contemporaries were lorenzo de\\' medici (il magnifico), who was three years older, and his younger brother giuliano, who was slain in the pazzi conspiracy in 1478. leonardo was sent as an ambassador by the medici court to ludovico il moro, who ruled milan between 1479 and 1499.with alberti, leonardo visited the home of the medici and through them came to know the older humanist philosophers of whom marsiglio ficino, proponent of neo platonism; cristoforo landino, writer of commentaries on classical writings, and john argyropoulos, teacher of greek and translator of aristotle were the foremost. also associated with the academy of the medici was leonardo\\'s contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher pico della mirandola. leonardo later wrote in the margin of a journal, \"the medici made me and the medici destroyed me.\" while it was through the action of lorenzo that leonardo received his employment at the court of milan, it is not known exactly what leonardo meant by this cryptic comment.although usually named together as the three giants of the high renaissance, leonardo, michelangelo and raphael were not of the same generation. leonardo was 23 when michelangelo was born and 31 when raphael was born. raphael died at the age of 37 in 1520, the year after leonardo died, but michelangelo went on creating for another 45 years.\\n\\n\\n=== personal life ===\\n\\nwithin leonardo\\'s lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his \"outstanding physical beauty,\" \"infinite grace,\" \"great strength and generosity,\" \"regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind,\" as described by vasari, as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. one such aspect was his vegetarianism and his habit, according to vasari, of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.leonardo had many friends who are now renowned either in their fields or for their historical significance. they included the mathematician luca pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book divina proportione in the 1490s. leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with cecilia gallerani and the two este sisters, beatrice and isabella. while on a journey that took him through mantua, he drew a portrait of isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.beyond friendship, leonardo kept his private life secret. his sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. this trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by sigmund freud. leonardo\\'s most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils salaì and melzi. melzi, writing to inform leonardo\\'s brothers of his death, described leonardo\\'s feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. it has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, lionardo de tornabuoni, was related to lorenzo de\\' medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in saint john the baptist and bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.\\n\\n\\n=== assistants and pupils ===\\n\\ngian giacomo caprotti da oreno, nicknamed salaì or il salaino (\"the little unclean one,\" i.e., the devil), entered leonardo\\'s household in 1490. after only a year, leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him \"a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton,\" after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes. nevertheless, leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in leonardo\\'s household for the next thirty years. salaì executed a number of paintings under the name of andrea salaì, but although vasari claims that leonardo \"taught him a great deal about painting,\" his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among leonardo\\'s pupils, such as marco d\\'oggiono and boltraffio. in 1515, he painted a nude version of the mona lisa, known as monna vanna. salaì owned the mona lisa at the time of his death in 1524, and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.in 1506, leonardo took on another pupil, count francesco melzi, the son of a lombard aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student. he travelled to france with leonardo and remained with him until leonardo\\'s death. melzi inherited the artistic and scientific works, manuscripts, and collections of leonardo and administered the estate.\\n\\n\\n== painting ==\\n\\ndespite the recent awareness and admiration of leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter. a handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces. these paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. by the 1490s leonardo had already been described as a \"divine\" painter.among the qualities that make leonardo\\'s work unique are his innovative techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. all these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the mona lisa, the last supper, and the virgin of the rocks.\\n\\n\\n=== early works ===\\n\\nleonardo first gained attention for his work on the baptism of christ, painted in conjunction with verrocchio. two other paintings appear to date from his time at verrocchio\\'s workshop, both of which are annunciations. one is small, 59 centimetres (23 in) long and 14 centimetres (5.5 in) high. it is a \"predella\" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by lorenzo di credi from which it has become separated. the other is a much larger work, 217 centimetres (85 in) long. in both annunciations, leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by fra angelico of the same subject, of the virgin mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. although previously attributed to ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to leonardo.in the smaller painting, mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to god\\'s will. mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. the girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. this calm young woman appears to accept her role as the mother of god, not with resignation but with confidence. in this painting, the young leonardo presents the humanist face of the virgin mary, recognising humanity\\'s role in god\\'s incarnation.\\n\\n\\n=== paintings of the 1480s ===\\nin the 1480s, leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.\\n\\none of these paintings was saint jerome in the wilderness, which bortolon associates with a difficult period of leonardo\\'s life, as evidenced in his diary: \"i thought i was learning to live; i was only learning to die.\" although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. jerome, as a penitent, occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. his kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. j. wasserman points out the link between this painting and leonardo\\'s anatomical studies. across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. the other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.\\nthe daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the adoration of the magi, a commission from the monks of san donato a scopeto. it is a complex composition, of about 250 x 250 centimetres. leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined classical architecture that forms part of the background. in 1482 leonardo went to milan at the behest of lorenzo de\\' medici in order to win favour with ludovico il moro, and the painting was abandoned.the third important work of this period is the virgin of the rocks, commissioned in milan for the confraternity of the immaculate conception. the painting, to be done with the assistance of the de predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of christ when the infant john the baptist, in protection of an angel, met the holy family on the road to egypt. the painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. while the painting is quite large, about 200×120 centimetres, it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of st donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. the painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the confraternity, while leonardo took the other to france. the brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de predis their payment, until the next century.\\n\\n\\n=== paintings of the 1490s ===\\n\\nleonardo\\'s most famous painting of the 1490s is the last supper, commissioned for the refectory of the convent of santa maria della grazie in milan. it represents the last meal shared by jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when jesus has just said \"one of you will betray me\", and the consternation that this statement caused.the novelist matteo bandello observed leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time. this was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until leonardo asked ludovico to intervene. vasari describes how leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of christ and the traitor judas, told the duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.when finished, the painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterization, but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as \"completely ruined.\" leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking. despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in various mediums.\\n\\nremarkable is the portrait of cecilia gallerani (c. 1483–1490), lover of leonardo\\'s patron ludovico sforza. interpretation of the portrait stating that it has allegorical elements has contradicted the theory that leonardo\\'s portrait painting had only a realistic character. there is few interpretations of the portrait, one considering that the portrayed woman was actually pregnant with ludovico, and the ermine she holds is an allegorical statement of that fact. also the animal\\'s greek name is galé, which itself is part of the surname of the model: gallerani. the animal is also a readable symbol of ludovico sforza himself, called by the contemporary \"ermellino,\" meaning \"ermine,\" in reference to the prestigious order of the ermine, of which he was a beholder, and whose image he used as his emblem. the painting is in the possession of national museum in kraków, poland.\\n\\n\\n=== paintings of the 16th century ===\\n\\namong the works created by leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the mona lisa or la gioconda, the laughing one. in the present era, it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman\\'s face, its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. the shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called \"sfumato,\" or leonardo\\'s smoke. vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that \"the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original.\"other characteristics of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details; the dramatic landscape background, in which the world seems to be in a state of flux; the subdued colouring; and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera, and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable. vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even \"the most confident master...despair and lose heart.\" the perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.in the painting virgin and child with st. anne, the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape, which wasserman describes as \"breathtakingly beautiful\" and harkens back to the st jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. what makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. mary is seated on the knee of her mother, st anne. she leans forward to restrain the christ child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. this painting, which was copied many times, influenced michelangelo, raphael, and andrea del sarto, and through them pontormo and correggio. the trends in composition were adopted in particular by the venetian painters tintoretto and veronese.\\n\\n\\n=== murals ===\\nleonardo\\'s the battle of anghiari was a fresco commissioned in 1505 for the salone dei cinquecento (hall of the five hundred) in the palazzo vecchio, florence. its central scene depicted four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the battle of anghiari in 1440. at the same time his rival michelangelo, who had just finished his david, was assigned the opposite wall. all that remains of leonardo\\'s work is a copy by rubens, but maurizio seracini is convinced it can still be found and has spent a lifetime searching for it. he was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the salone dei cinquecento, and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.in the sforza castle in milan, there is a room decorated with the fresco technique by leonardo and his assistants: sala delle asse (in english, \"room of the wooden boards\"). the room was decorated with a trompe-l\\'œil depicting trees, with an intricate labyrinth of leaves and knots on the ceiling. the red fruits of mulberry (\"moroni\" in local dialect) were an allusion to the name of \"ludovico il moro,\" duke of milan at that time. the first document about the room and leonardo\\'s work dates back to 1498: on 21 april, the secretary confirms to the duke that \"magistro leonardo\" will complete the decoration by september. two restorations were accomplished, in 1902 and 1956. another restoration is currently underway, thanks to which beautiful preparatory drawings have been uncovered on the walls: roots of trees penetrating the stones of the foundations.\\n\\n\\n== drawings ==\\n\\nleonardo was not a prolific painter, but he was a most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. as well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as the adoration of the magi, the virgin of the rocks and the last supper.\\nhis earliest dated drawing is a landscape of the arno valley, 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, montelupo castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail. according to art historian ludwig heydenreich, this is \"the first true landscape in art.\" massimo polidoro says that it was the first landscape \"not to be the background of some religious scene or a portrait. it is the first [documented] time where a landscape was drawn just for the sake of it.\"\\n\\namong his famous drawings are the vitruvian man, a study of the proportions of the human body; the head of an angel, for the virgin of the rocks in the louvre; a botanical study of star of bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100 cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of the virgin and child with st. anne and st. john the baptist in the national gallery, london. this drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the mona lisa. it is thought that leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to the virgin and child with st. anne in the louvre.other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as \"caricatures\" because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. vasari relates that if leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them. there are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with salaì, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called \"grecian profile.\" these faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior. salaì is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. a marked development in leonardo\\'s ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by leonardo in florence in 1479 showing the body of bernardo baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of giuliano, brother of lorenzo de\\' medici, in the pazzi conspiracy. in his notes, leonardo recorded the colours of the robes that baroncelli was wearing when he died.\\n\\n\\n== journals and notes ==\\n\\nrenaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and leonardo\\'s studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. these studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). they were made and maintained daily throughout leonardo\\'s life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.\\nleonardo\\'s notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. there are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.\\n\\nthese notebooks—originally loose papers of different types and sizes, were largely entrusted to leonardo\\'s pupil and heir francesco melzi after the master\\'s death. these were to be published, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and leonardo\\'s idiosyncratic writing. some of leonardo\\'s drawings were copied by an anonymous milanese artist for a planned treatise on art c. 1570. after melzi\\'s death in 1570, the collection passed to his son, the lawyer orazio, who initially took little interest in the journals. in 1587, a melzi household tutor named lelio gavardi took 13 of the manuscripts to pisa; there, the architect giovanni magenta reproached gavardi for having taken the manuscripts illicitly and returned them to orazio. having many more such works in his possession, orazio gifted the volumes to magenta. news spread of these lost works of leonardo\\'s, and orazio retrieved seven of the 13 manuscripts, which he then gave to pompeo leoni for publication in two volumes; one of these was the codex atlanticus. the other six works had been distributed to a few others. after orazio\\'s death, his heirs sold the rest of leonardo\\'s possessions, and thus began their dispersal.some works have found their way into major collections such as the royal library at windsor castle, the louvre, the biblioteca nacional de españa, the victoria and albert museum, the biblioteca ambrosiana in milan, which holds the 12-volume codex atlanticus, and the british library in london, which has put a selection from the codex arundel (bl arundel ms 263) online. works have also been at holkham hall, the metropolitan museum of art, and in the private hands of john nicholas brown i and robert lehman. the codex leicester is the only privately owned major scientific work of leonardo; it is owned by bill gates and displayed once a year in different cities around the world.\\nmost of leonardo\\'s writings are in mirror-image cursive. since leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left. leonardo used a variety of shorthand and symbols, and states in his notes that he intended to prepare them for publication. in many cases a single topic is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet, together conveying information that would not be lost if the pages were published out of order. why they were not published during leonardo\\'s lifetime is unknown.\\n\\n\\n=== scientific studies ===\\n\\nleonardo\\'s approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. since he lacked formal education in latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself latin. in the 1490s he studied mathematics under luca pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for pacioli\\'s book divina proportione, published in 1509. while living in milan, he studied light from the summit of monte rosa. scientific writings in his notebook on fossils have been considered as influential on early palaeontology and he has been called the father of ichnology.the content of his journals suggest that he was planning a series of treatises to be published on a variety of subjects. a coherent treatise on anatomy was said to have been observed during a visit by cardinal louis d\\'aragon\\'s secretary in 1517. aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by melzi and eventually published as a treatise on painting in france and italy in 1651 and germany in 1724, with engravings based upon drawings by the classical painter nicolas poussin. according to arasse, the treatise, which in france went into 62 editions in fifty years, caused leonardo to be seen as \"the precursor of french academic thought on art.\"while leonardo\\'s experimentation followed clear scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of leonardo as a scientist by fritjof capra argues that leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from galileo, newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a \"renaissance man\", his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.\\n\\n\\n=== anatomy and physiology ===\\n\\nleonardo started his study in the anatomy of the human body under the apprenticeship of andrea del verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. as an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.\\nas a successful artist, leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the hospital of santa maria nuova in florence and later at hospitals in milan and rome. from 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor marcantonio della torre. leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. only a small amount of the material on anatomy was published in leonardo\\'s treatise on painting. during the time that melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including vasari, cellini and albrecht dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.\\n\\nleonardo\\'s anatomical drawings include many studies of the human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. he studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. he drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. the drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.leonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. he drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. he also made a number of studies of horses.leonardo\\'s dissections and documentation of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped to describe the physiology and mechanics of movement. he attempted to identify the source of \\'emotions\\' and their expression. he found it difficult to incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. he made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. he documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. he was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. he created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns. vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in de humani corporis fabrica in 1543.\\n\\n\\n=== engineering and inventions ===\\n\\nduring his lifetime, leonardo was valued as an engineer. in a letter to ludovico il moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. when he fled to venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. in 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the arno river, a project on which niccolò machiavelli also worked. he continued to contemplate the canalization of lombardy\\'s plains while in louis xii\\'s company and of the loire and its tributaries in the company of francis i. leonardo\\'s journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. they include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.\\n\\nin 1502, leonardo produced a drawing of a single-span 220-metre (720 ft) bridge as part of a civil engineering project for ottoman sultan beyazid ii of constantinople. the bridge was intended to span the golden horn inlet at the mouth of the bosporus strait. the enormous bridge design utilized a voussoir-style arch, though leonardo was unable to provide instructions on how to build it; consequently, beyazid did not pursue the project. leonardo\\'s vision was resurrected in 2001 when a smaller bridge based on his design, but built of wood, was opened in norway. an extensive research study at mit, published in 2019, concluded that leonardo\\'s design for the massive bridge to span the golden horn inlet was viable, if built of stone, and would have been able to withstand seismic tremors.leonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of flight for much of his life, producing many studies, including codex on the flight of birds (c. 1505), as well as plans for several flying machines, such as a flapping ornithopter and a machine with a helical rotor. a 2003 documentary by british television station channel four, titled leonardo\\'s dream machines, various designs by leonardo, such as a parachute and a giant crossbow, were interpreted and constructed. some of those designs proved successful, whilst others fared less well when tested.\\nresearch performed by marc van den broek revealed older prototypes for more than 100 inventions that are ascribed to leonardo. similarities between leonardo´s illustrations and drawings from the middle ages and from ancient greece and rome, the chinese and persian empires, and egypt suggest that a large portion of leonardo\\'s inventions had been conceived before his lifetime. leonardo´s innovation was to combine different functions from existing drafts and set them into scenes that illustrated their utility. by reconstituting technical inventions he created something new.\\n\\n\\n== fame and reputation ==\\n\\nleonardo\\'s fame within his own lifetime was such that the king of france carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. interest in leonardo and his work has never diminished. crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, t-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.the continued admiration that leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. baldassare castiglione, author of il cortegiano (the courtier), wrote in 1528: \"...another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled...\" while the biographer known as \"anonimo gaddiano\" wrote, c.\\u20091540: \"his genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf...\"\\n\\ngiorgio vasari, in the enlarged edition of lives of the artists (1568) introduced his chapter on leonardo with the following words:\\n\\nin the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from god rather than from human skill. everyone acknowledged that this was true of leonardo da vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.\\n\\nthe 19th century brought a particular admiration for leonardo\\'s genius, causing henry fuseli to write in 1801: \"such was the dawn of modern art, when leonardo da vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius...\" this is echoed by a.e. rio who wrote in 1861: \"he towered above all other artists through the strength and the nobility of his talents.\"\\n\\nby the 19th century, the scope of leonardo\\'s notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. hippolyte taine wrote in 1866: \"there may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries.\"\\nart historian bernard berenson wrote in 1896: \"leonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. whether it be the cross section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever transmuted it into life-communicating values.\"the interest in leonardo\\'s genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found. liana bortolon, writing in 1967, said: \"because of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every field of knowledge...leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, to have been the universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. five centuries have passed, yet we still view leonardo with awe.\"twenty-first-century author walter isaacson based much of his biography of leonardo on thousands of notebook entries, studying the personal notes, sketches, budget notations, and musings of the man whom he considers the greatest of innovators. isaacson was surprised to discover a \"fun, joyous\" side of leonardo in addition to his limitless curiosity and creative genius.on the 500th anniversary of leonardo\\'s death, the louvre in paris arranged for the largest ever single exhibit of his work, called leonardo, between november 2019 and february 2020. the exhibit includes over 100 paintings, drawings and notebooks. eleven of the paintings that leonardo completed in his lifetime were included. five of these are owned by the louvre, but the mona lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among general visitors to the louvre; it remains on display in its gallery. vitruvian man, however, is on display following a legal battle with its owner, the gallerie dell\\'accademia in venice. salvator mundi was also not included because its saudi owner did not agree to lease the work.\\n\\n\\n== location of remains ==\\n\\nmuch of the collegiate church of saint florentin at the château d\\'amboise, where leonardo was buried, was damaged during the french revolution, leading to the church\\'s demolition in 1802. some of the graves were destroyed in the process, scattering the bones interred there and thereby leaving the whereabouts of leonardo\\'s remains subject to dispute. while excavating the site in 1863, fine-arts inspector general arsène houssaye found a partially complete skeleton with a bronze ring on one finger, some white hair, and stone fragments bearing the inscriptions \"eo,\" \"ar,\" \"dus,\" and \"vinc\"—interpreted as forming \"leonardus vinci\". a silver shield found near the bones depicts a beardless francis i, corresponding to the king\\'s appearance during leonardo\\'s lifetime, and the skull\\'s inclusion of eight teeth corresponds to someone of approximately the appropriate age. the unusually large skull led houssaye to believe that he had located leonardo\\'s remains, but he thought the skeleton seemed too short. other art historians say that the 1.73 metres (5.7 ft) tall skeleton may well be leonardo\\'s.the remains, except for the ring and a lock of hair which houssaye kept, were brought to paris in a lead box, where the skull was allegedly presented to napoleon iii, before being returned to the château d\\'amboise and re-interred in the chapel of saint hubert in 1874. a new memorial tombstone was added by sculptor francesco la monaca in the 1930s. reflecting doubts about the attribution, a plaque above the tomb states that the remains are only presumed to be those of leonardo. it has since been theorized that the folding of the skeleton\\'s right arm over the head may correspond to the paralysis of leonardo\\'s right hand.\\nin 2016, it was announced that dna tests would be conducted to determine whether the attribution is correct. the dna of the remains will be compared to that of samples collected from leonardo\\'s work and his half-brother domenico\\'s descendants; it may also be sequenced. the lock of hair and ring, now in a private us collection, were displayed in vinci beginning on 2 may 2019, the 500th anniversary of the artist\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n== art market ==\\nsalvator mundi, a painting by leonardo depicting jesus holding an

              "       ['michael faraday  frs (; 22 september 1791 – 25 august 1867) was an english scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. his main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.\\nalthough faraday received little formal education, he was one of the most influential scientists in history. it was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. he similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction and diamagnetism, and the laws of electrolysis. his inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology.\\nas a chemist, faraday discovered benzene, investigated the clathrate hydrate of chlorine, invented an early form of the bunsen burner and the system of oxidation numbers, and popularised terminology such as \"anode\", \"cathode\", \"electrode\" and \"ion\". faraday ultimately became the first and foremost fullerian professor of chemistry at the royal institution, a lifetime position.\\nfaraday was an excellent experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language; his mathematical abilities, however, did not extend as far as trigonometry and were limited to the simplest algebra. james clerk maxwell took the work of faraday and others and summarized it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. on faraday\\'s uses of lines of force, maxwell wrote that they show faraday \"to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods.\" the si unit of capacitance is named in his honour: the farad.\\nalbert einstein kept a picture of faraday on his study wall, alongside pictures of isaac newton and james clerk maxwell. physicist ernest rutherford stated, \"when we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry, there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of faraday, one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all time.\"\\n\\n\\n== personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== early life ===\\n\\nmichael faraday was born on 22 september 1791 in newington butts, which is now part of the london borough of southwark but was then a suburban part of surrey.  his family was not well off. his father, james, was a member of the glassite sect of christianity. james faraday moved his wife and two children to london during the winter of 1790 from outhgill in westmorland, where he had been an apprentice to the village blacksmith.  michael was born in the autumn of that year. the young michael faraday, who was the third of four children, having only the most basic school education, had to educate himself.at the age of 14 he became an apprentice to george riebau, a local bookbinder and bookseller in blandford street. during his seven-year apprenticeship faraday read many books, including isaac watts\\'s the improvement of the mind, and he enthusiastically implemented the principles and suggestions contained therein. he also developed an interest in science, especially in electricity. faraday was particularly inspired by the book conversations on chemistry by jane marcet.\\n\\n\\n=== adult life ===\\n\\nin 1812, at the age of 20 and at the end of his apprenticeship, faraday attended lectures by the eminent english chemist humphry davy of the royal institution and the royal society, and john tatum, founder of the city philosophical society. many of the tickets for these lectures were given to faraday by william dance, who was one of the founders of the royal philharmonic society. faraday subsequently sent davy a 300-page book based on notes that he had taken during these lectures. davy\\'s reply was immediate, kind, and favourable. in 1813, when davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with nitrogen trichloride, he decided to employ faraday as an assistant. coincidentally one of the royal institution\\'s assistants, john payne, was sacked and sir humphry davy had been asked to find a replacement; thus he appointed faraday as chemical assistant at the royal institution on 1 march 1813. very soon davy entrusted faraday with the preparation of nitrogen trichloride samples, and they both were injured in an explosion of this very sensitive substance.\\n\\nin the class-based english society of the time, faraday was not considered a gentleman. when davy set out on a long tour of the continent in 1813–15, his valet did not wish to go, so instead, faraday went as davy\\'s scientific assistant and was asked to act as davy\\'s valet until a replacement could be found in paris. faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip. davy\\'s wife, jane apreece, refused to treat faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc.), and made faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to england alone and giving up science altogether. the trip did, however, give him access to the scientific elite of europe and exposed him to a host of stimulating ideas.faraday married sarah barnard (1800–1879) on 12 june 1821. they met through their families at the sandemanian church, and he confessed his faith to the sandemanian congregation the month after they were married. they had no children.faraday was a devout christian; his sandemanian denomination was an offshoot of the church of scotland. well after his marriage, he served as deacon and for two terms as an elder in the meeting house of his youth. his church was located at paul\\'s alley in the barbican. this meeting house relocated in 1862 to barnsbury grove, islington; this north london location was where faraday served the final two years of his second term as elder prior to his resignation from that post.  biographers have noted that \"a strong sense of the unity of god and nature pervaded faraday\\'s life and work.\"\\n\\n\\n=== later life ===\\n\\nin june 1832, the university of oxford granted faraday an honorary doctor of civil law degree. during his lifetime, he was offered a knighthood in recognition for his services to science, which he turned down on religious grounds, believing that it was against the word of the bible to accumulate riches and pursue worldly reward, and stating that he preferred to remain \"plain mr faraday to the end\". elected a member of the royal society in 1824, he twice refused to become president. he became the first fullerian professor of chemistry at the royal institution in 1833.in 1832, faraday was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences. he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1838, and was one of eight foreign members elected to the french academy of sciences in 1844. in 1849 he was elected as associated member to the royal institute of the netherlands, which two years later became the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences and he was subsequently made foreign member.\\n\\nfaraday suffered a nervous breakdown in 1839 but eventually returned to his investigations into electromagnetism. in 1848, as a result of representations by the prince consort, faraday was awarded a grace and favour house in hampton court in middlesex, free of all expenses and upkeep. this was the master mason\\'s house, later called faraday house, and now no. 37 hampton court road. in 1858 faraday retired to live there.having provided a number of various service projects for the british government, when asked by the government to advise on the production of chemical weapons for use in the crimean war (1853–1856), faraday refused to participate citing ethical reasons.faraday died at his house at hampton court on 25 august 1867, aged 75. he had some years before turned down an offer of burial in westminster abbey upon his death, but he has a memorial plaque there, near isaac newton\\'s tomb. faraday was interred in the dissenters\\' (non-anglican) section of highgate cemetery.\\n\\n\\n== scientific achievements ==\\n\\n\\n=== chemistry ===\\n\\nfaraday\\'s earliest chemical work was as an assistant to humphry davy. faraday was specifically involved in the study of chlorine; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and carbon. he also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by john dalton. the physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by thomas graham and joseph loschmidt. faraday succeeded in liquefying several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. a specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. this specimen was also the first substance found to be repelled by the poles of a magnet.\\nfaraday invented an early form of what was to become the bunsen burner, which is in practical use in science laboratories around the world as a convenient source of heat.\\nfaraday worked extensively in the field of chemistry, discovering chemical substances such as benzene (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen) and liquefying gases such as chlorine. the liquefying of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. in 1820 faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, c2cl6 and c2cl4, and published his results the following year. faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by humphry davy in 1810. faraday is also responsible for discovering the laws of electrolysis, and for popularizing terminology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion, terms proposed in large part by william whewell.faraday was the first to report what later came to be called metallic nanoparticles. in 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold colloids differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal. this was probably the first reported observation of the effects of quantum size, and might be considered to be the birth of nanoscience.\\n\\n\\n=== electricity and magnetism ===\\nfaraday is best known for his work regarding electricity and magnetism. his first recorded experiment was the construction of a voltaic pile with seven ha\\'penny coins, stacked together with seven disks of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. with this pile he decomposed sulfate of magnesia (first letter to abbott, 12 july 1812).\\n\\nin 1821, soon after the danish physicist and chemist hans christian ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, davy and british scientist william hyde wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called \"electromagnetic rotation\". one of these, now known as the homopolar motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. these experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. in his excitement, faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either wollaston or davy. the resulting controversy within the royal society strained his mentor relationship with davy and may well have contributed to faraday\\'s assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.\\n\\nfrom his initial discovery in 1821, faraday continued his laboratory work, exploring electromagnetic properties of materials and developing requisite experience. in 1824, faraday briefly set up a circuit to study whether a magnetic field could regulate the flow of a current in an adjacent wire, but he found no such relationship. this experiment followed similar work conducted with light and magnets three years earlier that yielded identical results. during the next seven years, faraday spent much of his time perfecting his recipe for optical quality (heavy) glass, borosilicate of lead, which he used in his future studies connecting light with magnetism.  in his spare time, faraday continued publishing his experimental work on optics and electromagnetism; he conducted correspondence with scientists whom he had met on his journeys across europe with davy, and who were also working on electromagnetism. two years after the death of davy, in 1831, he began his great series of experiments in which he discovered electromagnetic induction, recording in his laboratory diary on 28 october 1831 he was; \"making many experiments with the great magnet of the royal society\".\\n\\nfaraday\\'s breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary current was induced in the other coil. this phenomenon is now known as mutual induction. the iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the royal institution. in subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. the current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. his demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by james clerk maxwell as faraday\\'s law, which subsequently became one of the four maxwell equations, and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as field theory. faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric dynamo, the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.\\n\\nin 1832, he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity; faraday used \"static\", batteries, and \"animal electricity\" to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, electrolysis, magnetism, etc. he concluded that, contrary to the scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various \"kinds\" of electricity were illusory. faraday instead proposed that only a single \"electricity\" exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (current and voltage) would produce different groups of phenomena.near the end of his career, faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor. this idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community. faraday\\'s concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields; that conceptual model was crucial for the successful development of the electromechanical devices that dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 19th century.\\n\\n\\n=== diamagnetism ===\\n\\nin 1845, faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: a phenomenon he termed diamagnetism.faraday also discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving. this is now termed the faraday effect. in sept 1845 he wrote in his notebook, \"i have at last succeeded in illuminating a magnetic curve or line of force and in magnetising a ray of light\".later on in his life, in 1862, faraday used a spectroscope to search for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. the equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. pieter zeeman later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 nobel prize in physics for his success. in both his 1897 paper and his nobel acceptance speech, zeeman made reference to faraday\\'s work.\\n\\n\\n=== faraday cage ===\\nin his work on static electricity, faraday\\'s ice pail experiment demonstrated that the charge resided only on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor. this is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields emanating from them cancel one another. this shielding effect is used in what is now known as a faraday cage.\\n\\n\\n== royal institution and public service ==\\n\\nfaraday had a long association with the royal institution of great britain.  he was appointed assistant superintendent of the house of the royal institution in 1821.  he was elected a member of the royal society in 1824. in 1825, he became director of the laboratory of the royal institution.  six years later, in 1833, faraday became the first fullerian professor of chemistry at the royal institution of great britain, a position to which he was appointed for life without the obligation to deliver lectures. his sponsor and mentor was john \\'mad jack\\' fuller, who created the position at the royal institution for faraday.beyond his scientific research into areas such as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the royal institution, faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the british government. this work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an expert witness in court, and along with two engineers from chance brothers c.1853, the preparation of high-quality optical glass, which was required by chance for its lighthouses. in 1846, together with charles lyell, he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious explosion in the colliery at haswell, county durham, which killed 95 miners. their report was a meticulous forensic investigation and indicated that coal dust contributed to the severity of the explosion. the report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the senghenydd colliery disaster of 1913.\\n\\nas a respected scientist in a nation with strong maritime interests, faraday spent extensive amounts of time on projects such as the construction and operation of lighthouses and protecting the bottoms of ships from corrosion. his workshop still stands at trinity buoy wharf above the chain and buoy store, next to london\\'s only lighthouse where he carried out the first experiments in electric lighting for lighthouses.faraday was also active in what would now be called environmental science, or engineering. he investigated industrial pollution at swansea and was consulted on air pollution at the royal mint. in july 1855, faraday wrote a letter to the times on the subject of the foul condition of the river thames, which resulted in an often-reprinted cartoon in punch. (see also the great stink).\\n\\nfaraday assisted with the planning and judging of exhibits for the great exhibition of 1851 in london. he also advised the national gallery on the cleaning and protection of its art collection, and served on the national gallery site commission in 1857. education was another of faraday\\'s areas of service; he lectured on the topic in 1854 at the royal institution, and in 1862 he appeared before a public schools commission to give his views on education in great britain. faraday also weighed in negatively on the public\\'s fascination with table-turning, mesmerism, and seances, and in so doing chastised both the public and the nation\\'s educational system.\\n\\nbefore his famous christmas lectures, faraday delivered chemistry lectures for the city philosophical society from 1816 to 1818 in order to refine the quality of his lectures. between 1827 and 1860 at the royal institution in london, faraday gave a series of nineteen christmas lectures for young people, a series which continues today. the objective of faraday\\'s christmas lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them and generating revenue for the royal institution. they were notable events on the social calendar among london\\'s gentry. over the course of several letters to his close friend benjamin abbott, faraday outlined his recommendations on the art of lecturing: faraday wrote \"a flame should be lighted at the commencement and kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end\". his lectures were joyful and juvenile, he delighted in filling soap bubbles with various gasses (in order to determine whether or not they are magnetic) in front of his audiences and marveled at the rich colors of polarized lights, but the lectures were also deeply philosophical. in his lectures he urged his audiences to consider the mechanics of his experiments: \"you know very well that ice floats upon water ... why does the ice float? think of that, and philosophise\". his subjects consisted of chemistry and electricity, and included: 1841 the rudiments of chemistry, 1843 first principles of electricity, 1848 the chemical history of a candle, 1851 attractive forces, 1853 voltaic electricity, 1854 the chemistry of combustion, 1855 the distinctive properties of the common metals, 1857 static electricity, 1858 the metallic properties, 1859 the various forces of matter and their relations to each other.\\n\\n\\n== commemorations ==\\n\\na statue of faraday stands in savoy place, london, outside the institution of engineering and technology. the michael faraday memorial, designed by brutalist architect rodney gordon and completed in 1961, is at the elephant & castle gyratory system, near faraday\\'s birthplace at newington butts, london. faraday school is located on trinity buoy wharf where his workshop still stands above the chain and buoy store, next to london\\'s only lighthouse. faraday gardens is a small park in walworth, london, not far from his birthplace at newington butts. it lies within the local council ward of faraday in the london borough of southwark. michael faraday primary school is situated on the aylesbury estate in walworth.a building at london south bank university, which houses the institute\\'s electrical engineering departments is named the faraday wing, due to its proximity to faraday\\'s birthplace in newington butts. a hall at loughborough university was named after faraday in 1960. near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an electrical transformer, and inside there hangs a portrait, both in faraday\\'s honour. an eight-story building at the university of edinburgh\\'s science & engineering campus is named for faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at brunel university, the main engineering building at swansea university, and the instructional and experimental physics building at northern illinois university. the former uk faraday station in antarctica was named after him.\\n\\nstreets named for faraday can be found in many british cities (e.g., london, fife, swindon, basingstoke, nottingham, whitby, kirkby, crawley, newbury, swansea, aylesbury and stevenage) as well as in france (paris), germany (berlin-dahlem, hermsdorf), canada (quebec city, quebec; deep river, ontario; ottawa, ontario), and the united states (reston, virginia).\\n\\na royal society of arts blue plaque, unveiled in 1876, commemorates faraday at 48 blandford street in london\\'s marylebone district. from 1991 until 2001, faraday\\'s picture featured on the reverse of series e £20 banknotes issued by the bank of england. he was portrayed conducting a lecture at the royal institution with the magneto-electric spark apparatus. in 2002, faraday was ranked number 22 in the bbc\\'s list of the 100 greatest britons following a uk-wide vote.the faraday institute for science and religion derives its name from the scientist, who saw his faith as integral to his scientific research. the logo of the institute is also based on faraday\\'s discoveries. it was created in 2006 by a $2,000,000 grant from the john templeton foundation to carry out academic research, to foster understanding of the interaction between science and religion, and to engage public understanding in both these subject areas.faraday\\'s life and contributions to electromagnetics was the principal topic of the tenth episode, titled \"the electric boy\", of the 2014 american science documentary series, cosmos: a spacetime odyssey, which was broadcast on fox and the national geographic channel.aldous huxley, the literary giant who was also the grandson of t. h. huxley, the grandnephew of matthew arnold, the brother of julian huxley, and the half-brother of andrew huxley, was well-versed in science. he wrote about faraday in an essay entitled, a night in pietramala: “he is always the natural philosopher. to discover truth is his sole aim and interest…even if i could be shakespeare, i think i should still choose to be faraday.”\\n\\n\\n== faraday prizes & medals ==\\nin honor and remembrance of his great scientific contributions, several institutions have created prizes and awards in his name. this include:\\n\\nthe iet faraday medal\\nthe royal society of london michael faraday prize\\nthe institute of physics michael faraday medal and prize\\nthe royal society of chemistry faraday lectureship prize\\n\\n\\n== gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== bibliography ==\\n\\nfaraday\\'s books, with the exception of chemical manipulation, were collections of scientific papers or transcriptions of lectures.  since his death, faraday\\'s diary has been published, as have several large volumes of his letters and faraday\\'s journal from his travels with davy in 1813–1815.\\n\\nfaraday, michael (1827). chemical manipulation, being instructions to students in chemistry. john murray.  2nd ed. 1830, 3rd ed. 1842\\nfaraday, michael (1839). experimental researches in electricity, vols. i. and ii. richard and john edward taylor.;

              "       ['macroeconomics (from the greek prefix makro- meaning \"large\" + economics) is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole. this includes regional, national, and global economies.while macroeconomics is a broad field of study, there are two areas of research that are emblematic of the discipline: the attempt to understand the causes and consequences of short-run fluctuations in national income (the business cycle), and the attempt to understand the determinants of long-run economic growth (increases in national income).\\nmacroeconomic models and their forecasts are used by governments to assist in the development and evaluation of economic policy.\\nmacroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as gdp, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, and the interrelations among the different sectors of the economy to better understand how the whole economy functions. they also develop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, saving, investment, energy, international trade, and international finance.\\nmacroeconomics and microeconomics, a pair of terms coined by ragnar frisch, are the two most general fields in economics. in contrast to macroeconomics, microeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions and the interactions among these individuals and firms in narrowly-defined markets. the central problems of an economy are 1. what to produce ? 2. how to produce ? 3. for whom to produce ?\\n\\n\\n== development ==\\n\\n\\n=== origins ===\\nmacroeconomics descended from the once divided fields of business cycle theory and monetary theory.  the quantity theory of money was particularly influential prior to world war ii. it took many forms, including the version based on the work of irving fisher:\\n\\n

quantity theory, money velocity (v) and the quantity of goods produced (q) would be constant, so any increase in money supply (m) would lead to a direct increase in price level (p). the quantity theory of money was a central part of the classical theory of the economy that prevailed in the early twentieth century.\\n\\n\\n=== austrian school ===\\nludwig von mises\\'s work theory of money and credit, published in 1912, was one of the first books from the austrian school to deal with macroeconomic topics.\\n\\n\\n=== keynes and his followers ===\\nmacroeconomics, at least in its modern form, began with the publication of john maynard keynes\\'s general theory of employment, interest and money. when the great depression struck, classical economists had difficulty explaining how goods could go unsold and workers could be left unemployed. in classical theory, prices and wages would drop until the market cleared, and all goods and labor were sold. keynes offered a new theory of economics that explained why markets might not clear, which would evolve (later in the 20th century) into a group of macroeconomic schools of thought known as keynesian economics – also called keynesianism or keynesian theory.\\nin keynes\\'s theory, the quantity theory broke down because people and businesses tend to hold on to their cash in tough economic times – a phenomenon he described in terms of liquidity preferences. keynes also explained how the multiplier effect would magnify a small decrease in consumption or investment and cause declines throughout the economy. keynes also noted the role uncertainty and animal spirits can play in the economy.the generation following keynes combined the macroeconomics of the general theory with neoclassical microeconomics to create the neoclassical synthesis. by the 1950s, most economists had accepted the synthesis view of the macroeconomy. economists like paul samuelson, franco modigliani, james tobin, and robert solow developed formal keynesian models and contributed formal theories of consumption, investment, and money demand that fleshed out the keynesian framework.\\n\\n\\n=== monetarism ===\\nmilton friedman updated the quantity theory of money to include a role for money demand. he argued that the role of money in the economy was sufficient to explain the great depression, and that aggregate demand oriented explanations were not necessary. friedman also argued that monetary policy was more effective than fiscal policy; however, friedman doubted the government\\'s ability to \"fine-tune\" the economy with monetary policy. he generally favored a policy of steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention.friedman also challenged the phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment. friedman and edmund phelps (who was not a monetarist) proposed an \"augmented\" version of the phillips curve that excluded the possibility of a stable, long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. when the oil shocks of the 1970s created a high unemployment and high inflation, friedman and phelps were vindicated. monetarism was particularly influential in the early 1980s. monetarism fell out of favor when central banks found it difficult to target money supply instead of interest rates as monetarists recommended. monetarism also became politically unpopular when the central banks created recessions in order to slow inflation.\\n\\n\\n=== new classical ===\\nnew classical macroeconomics further challenged the keynesian school. a central development in new classical thought came when robert lucas introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. prior to lucas, economists had generally used adaptive expectations where agents were assumed to look at the recent past to make expectations about the future. under rational expectations, agents are assumed to be more sophisticated. a consumer will not simply assume a 2% inflation rate just because that has been the average the past few years; she will look at current monetary policy and economic conditions to make an informed forecast. when new classical economists introduced rational expectations into their models, they showed that monetary policy could only have a limited impact.\\nlucas also made an influential critique of keynesian empirical models. he argued that forecasting models based on empirical relationships would keep producing the same predictions even as the underlying model generating the data changed. he advocated models based on fundamental economic theory that would, in principle, be structurally accurate as economies changed. following lucas\\'s critique, new classical economists, led by edward c. prescott and finn e. kydland, created real business cycle (rb c) models of the macro economy.rb c models were created by combining fundamental equations from neo-classical microeconomics. in order to generate macroeconomic fluctuations, rb c models explained recessions and unemployment with changes in technology instead of changes in the markets for goods or money. critics of rb c models argue that money clearly plays an important role in the economy, and the idea that technological regress can explain recent recessions is implausible. however, technological shocks are only the more prominent of a myriad of possible shocks to the system that can be modeled. despite questions about the theory behind rb c models, they have clearly been influential in economic methodology.\\n\\n\\n=== new keynesian response ===\\nnew keynesian economists responded to the new classical school by adopting rational expectations and focusing on developing micro-founded models that are immune to the lucas critique. stanley fischer and john b. taylor produced early work in this area by showing that monetary policy could be effective even in models with rational expectations when contracts locked in wages for workers. other new keynesian economists, including olivier blanchard, julio rotemberg, greg mankiw, david romer, and michael woodford, expanded on this work and demonstrated other cases where inflexible prices and wages led to monetary and fiscal policy having real effects.\\nlike classical models, new classical models had assumed that prices would be able to adjust perfectly and monetary policy would only lead to price changes. new keynesian models investigated sources of sticky prices and wages due to imperfect competition, which would not adjust, allowing monetary policy to impact quantities instead of prices.\\nby the late 1990s economists had reached a rough consensus. the nominal rigidity of new keynesian theory was combined with rational expectations and the rbc methodology to produce dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dsge) models. the fusion of elements from different schools of thought has been dubbed the new neoclassical synthesis. these models are now used by many central banks and are a core part of contemporary macroeconomics.new keynesian economics, which developed partly in response to new classical economics, strives to provide microeconomic foundations to keynesian economics by showing how imperfect markets can justify demand management.\\n\\n\\n== macroeconomic models ==\\n\\n\\n=== aggregate demand–aggregate supply ===\\n\\nthe ad-as model has become the standard textbook model for explaining the macroeconomy. this model shows the price level and level of real output given the equilibrium in aggregate demand and aggregate supply. the aggregate demand curve\\'s downward slope means that more output is demanded at lower price levels. the downward slope is the result of three effects: the pigou or real balance effect, which states that as real prices fall, real wealth increases, resulting in higher consumer demand of goods; the keynes or interest rate effect, which states that as prices fall, the demand for money decreases, causing interest rates to decline and borrowing for investment and consumption to increase; and the net export effect, which states that as prices rise, domestic goods become comparatively more expensive to foreign consumers, leading to a decline in exports.in the conventional keynesian use of the as-ad model, the aggregate supply curve is horizontal at low levels of output and becomes inelastic near the point of potential output, which corresponds with full employment. since the economy cannot produce beyond the potential output, any ad expansion will lead to higher price levels instead of higher output.\\nthe ad–as diagram can model a variety of macroeconomic phenomena, including inflation. changes in the non-price level factors or determinants cause changes in aggregate demand and shifts of the entire aggregate demand (ad) curve. when demand for goods exceeds supply there is an inflationary gap where demand-pull inflation occurs and the ad curve shifts upward to a higher price level. when the economy faces higher costs, cost-push inflation occurs and the as curve shifts upward to higher price levels. the as–ad diagram is also widely used as a pedagogical tool to model the effects of various macroeconomic policies.\\n\\n\\n=== is-lm ===\\n\\nthe is–lm model gives the underpinnings of aggregate demand (itself discussed above). it answers the question “at any given price level, what is the quantity of goods demanded?” this model shows represents what combination of interest rates and output will ensure equilibrium in both the goods and money markets. the goods market is modeled as giving equality between investment and public and private saving (is), and the money market is modeled as giving equilibrium between the money supply and liquidity preference.the is curve consists of the points (combinations of income and interest rate) where investment, given the interest rate, is equal to public and private saving, given output the is curve is downward sloping because output and the interest rate have an inverse relationship in the goods market: as output increases, more income is saved, which means interest rates must be lower to spur enough investment to match saving.the lm curve is upward sloping because the interest rate and output have a positive relationship in the money market: as income (identically equal to output) increases, the demand for money increases, resulting in a rise in the interest rate in order to just offset the insipient rise in money demand.the is-lm model is often used to demonstrate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy. textbooks frequently use the is-lm model, but it does not feature the complexities of most modern macroeconomic models. nevertheless, these models still feature similar relationships to those in is-lm.\\n\\n\\n=== growth models ===\\nthe neoclassical growth model of robert solow has become a common textbook model for explaining economic growth in the long-run. the model begins with a production function where national output is the product of two inputs: capital and labor. the solow model assumes that labor and capital are used at constant rates without the fluctuations in unemployment and capital utilization commonly seen in business cycles.an increase in output, or economic growth, can only occur because of an increase in the capital stock, a larger population, or technological advancements that lead to higher productivity (total factor productivity). an increase in the savings rate leads to a temporary increase as the economy creates more capital, which adds to output. however, eventually the depreciation rate will limit the expansion of capital: savings will be used up replacing depreciated capital, and no savings will remain to pay for an additional expansion in capital. solow\\'s model suggests that economic growth in terms of output per capita depends solely on technological advances that enhance productivity.in the 1980s and 1990s endogenous growth theory arose to challenge neoclassical growth theory. this group of models explains economic growth through other factors, such as increasing returns to scale for capital and learning-by-doing, that are endogenously determined instead of the exogenous technological improvement used to explain growth in solow\\'s model.\\n\\n\\n== basic macroeconomic concepts ==\\nmacroeconomics encompasses a variety of concepts and variables, but there are three central topics for macroeconomic research. macroeconomic theories usually relate the phenomena of output, unemployment, and inflation.  outside of macroeconomic theory, these topics are also important to all economic agents including workers, consumers, and producers.\\n\\n\\n=== output and income ===\\nnational output is the total amount of everything a country produces in a given period of time. everything that is produced and sold generates an equal amount of income. the total output of the economy is measured gdp per person. the output and income are usually considered equivalent and the two terms are often used interchangeably,output changes into income. output can be measured or it can be viewed from the production side and measured as the total value of final goods and services or the sum of all value added in the economy.macroeconomic output is usually measured by gross domestic product (gdp) or one of the other national accounts.  economists interested in long-run increases in output study economic growth. advances in technology, accumulation of machinery and other capital, and better education and human capital are all factors that lead to increase economic output over time. however, output does not always increase consistently over time. business cycles can cause short-term drops in output called recessions. economists look for macroeconomic policies that prevent economies from slipping into recessions and that lead to faster long-term growth.\\n\\n\\n=== unemployment ===\\n\\nthe amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, i.e. the percentage of workers without jobs in the labor force. the unemployment rate in the labor force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. people who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded.\\nunemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.\\n\\nclassical unemployment theory suggests that unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. other more modern economic theories suggest that increased wages actually decrease unemployment by creating more consumer demand. according to these more recent theories, unemployment results from reduced demand for the goods and services produced through labor and suggest that only in markets where profit margins are very low, and in which the market will not bear a price increase of product or service, will higher wages result in unemployment.\\nconsistent with classical unemployment theory, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.\\nstructural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers\\' skills and the skills required for open jobs.  large amounts of structural unemployment commonly occur when an economy shifts to focus on new industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment as both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment also covers the time needed to acquire new skills in addition to the short-term search process.\\nwhile some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. okun\\'s law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth. the original version of okun\\'s law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.\\n\\n\\n=== inflation and deflation ===\\n\\na general price increase across the entire economy is called inflation. when prices decrease, there is deflation. economists measure these changes in prices with price indexes. inflation can occur when an economy becomes overheated and grows too quickly. similarly, a declining economy can lead to deflation.\\ncentral bankers, who manage a country\\'s money supply, try to avoid changes in price level by using monetary policy. raising interest rates or reducing the supply of money in an economy will reduce inflation. inflation can lead to increased uncertainty and other negative consequences.  deflation can lower economic output. central bankers try to stabilize prices to protect economies from the negative consequences of price changes.\\nchanges in price level may be the result of several factors. the quantity theory of money holds that changes in price level are directly related to changes in the money supply. most economists believe that this relationship explains long-run changes in the price level. short-run fluctuations may also be related to monetary factors, but changes in aggregate demand and aggregate supply can also influence price level. for example, a decrease in demand due to a recession can lead to lower price levels and deflation. a negative supply shock, such as an oil crisis, lowers aggregate supply and can cause inflation.\\n\\n\\n== macroeconomic policy ==\\nmacroeconomic policy is usually implemented through two sets of tools: fiscal and monetary policy. both forms of policy are used to stabilize the economy, which can mean boosting the economy to the level of gdp consistent with full employment. macroeconomic policy focuses on limiting the effects of the business cycle to achieve the economic goals of price stability, full employment, and growth.\\n\\n\\n=== monetary policy ===\\n\\ncentral banks implement monetary policy by controlling the money supply through several mechanisms. typically, central banks take action by issuing money to buy bonds (or other assets), which boosts the supply of money and lowers interest rates, or, in the case of contractionary monetary policy, banks sell bonds and take money out of circulation. usually policy is not implemented by directly targeting the supply of money.\\ncentral banks continuously shift the money supply to maintain a targeted fixed interest rate. some of them allow the interest rate to fluctuate and focus on targeting inflation rates instead. central banks generally try to achieve high output without letting loose monetary policy that create large amounts of inflation.\\nconventional monetary policy can be ineffective in situations such as a liquidity trap. when interest rates and inflation are near zero, the central bank cannot loosen monetary policy through conventional means.\\n\\ncentral banks can use unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing to help increase output. instead of buying government bonds, central banks can implement quantitative easing by buying not only government bonds, but also other assets such as corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities. this allows lower interest rates for a broader class of assets beyond government bonds. in another example of unconventional monetary policy, the united states federal reserve recently made an attempt at such a policy with operation twist. unable to lower current interest rates, the federal reserve lowered long-term interest rates by buying long-term bonds and selling short-term bonds to create a flat yield curve.\\n\\n\\n=== fiscal policy ===\\n\\nfiscal policy is the use of government\\'s revenue and expenditure as instruments to influence the economy. examples of such tools are expenditure, taxes, debt.\\nfor example, if the economy is producing less than potential output, government spending can be used to employ idle resources and boost output. government spending does not have to make up for the entire output gap. there is a multiplier effect that boosts the impact of government spending. for instance, when the government pays for a bridge, the project not only adds the value of the bridge to output, but also allows the bridge workers to increase their consumption and investment, which helps to close the output gap.\\nthe effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out. when the government takes on spending projects, it limits the amount of resources available for the private sector to use. crowding out occurs when government spending simply replaces private sector output instead of adding additional output to the economy. crowding out also occurs when government spending raises interest rates, which limits investment. defenders of fiscal stimulus argue that crowding out is not a concern when the economy is depressed, plenty of resources are left idle, and interest rates are low.fiscal policy can be implemented through automatic stabilizers. automatic stabilizers do not suffer from the policy lags of discretionary fiscal policy. automatic stabilizers use conventional fiscal mechanisms but take effect as soon as the economy takes a downturn: spending on unemployment benefits automatically increases when unemployment rises and, in a progressive income tax system, the effective tax rate automatically falls when incomes decline.\\n\\n\\n=== comparison ===\\neconomists usually favor monetary over fiscal policy because it has two major advantages. first, monetary policy is generally implemented by independent central banks instead of the political institutions that control fiscal policy. independent central banks are less likely to make decisions based on political motives. second, monetary policy suffers shorter inside lags and outside lags than fiscal policy. central banks can quickly make and implement decisions while discretionary fiscal policy may take time to pass and even longer to carry out.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium\\neconomic development\\n\\n\\n== notes ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\nblanchard, olivier (2000). macroeconomics.

              "       ['a triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. it is one of the basic shapes in geometry. a triangle with vertices a, b, and c is denoted \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        △\\n        a\\n        b\\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\triangle abc}\\n  .\\nin euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional euclidean space). in other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane. if the entire geometry is only the euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. this article is about triangles in euclidean geometry, and in particular, the euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\n== types of triangle ==\\n\\n\\n=== by lengths of sides ===\\ntriangles can be classified according to the lengths of their sides:\\n\\nan equilateral triangle has all sides the same length. an equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60°.\\nan isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. an isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the two sides of the same length; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by euclid. some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. the latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. the 45–45–90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.\\na scalene triangle has all its sides of different lengths. equivalently, it has all angles of different measure.hatch marks, also called tick marks, are used in diagrams of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths. a side can be marked with a pattern of \"ticks\", short line segments in the form of tally marks; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern. in a triangle, the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks. an equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 sides, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 sides, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all sides since no sides are equal. similarly, patterns of 1, 2, or 3 concentric arcs inside the angles are used to indicate equal angles. an equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 angles, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 angles, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all angles since no angles are equal.\\n\\n\\n=== by internal angles ===\\ntriangles can also be classified according to their internal angles, measured here in degrees.\\n\\na right triangle (or right-angled triangle, formerly called a rectangled triangle) has one of its interior angles measuring 90° (a right angle). the side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse, the longest side of the triangle. the other two sides are called the legs or catheti (singular: cathetus) of the triangle. right triangles obey the pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse: a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. special right triangles are right triangles with additional properties that make calculations involving them easier. one of the two most famous is the 3–4–5 right triangle, where 32 + 42 = 52. in this situation, 3, 4, and 5 are a pythagorean triple. the other one is an isosceles triangle that has 2 angles that each measure 45 degrees.\\ntriangles that do not have an angle measuring 90° are called oblique triangles.\\na triangle with all interior angles measuring less than 90° is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. if c is the length of the longest side, then a2 + b2 > c2, where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.\\na triangle with one interior angle measuring more than 90° is an obtuse triangle or obtuse-angled triangle. if c is the length of the longest side, then a2 + b2 < c2, where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.\\na triangle with an interior angle of 180° (and collinear vertices) is degenerate.\\na right degenerate triangle has collinear vertices, two of which are coincident.a triangle that has two angles with the same measure also has two sides with the same length, and therefore it is an isosceles triangle. it follows that in a triangle where all angles have the same measure, all three sides have the same length, and such a triangle is therefore equilateral.\\n\\n\\n== basic facts ==\\n\\ntriangles are assumed to be two-dimensional plane figures, unless the context provides otherwise (see non-planar triangles, below). in rigorous treatments, a triangle is therefore called a 2-simplex (see also polytope). elementary facts about triangles were presented by euclid in books 1–4 of his elements, around 300 bc.\\n\\nthe sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle in euclidean space is always 180 degrees. this fact is equivalent to euclid\\'s parallel postulate. this allows determination of the measure of the third angle of any triangle given the measure of two angles. an exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. the sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.\\n\\n\\n=== similarity and congruence ===\\ntwo triangles are said to be similar if every angle of one triangle has the same measure as the corresponding angle in the other triangle. the corresponding sides of similar triangles have lengths that are in the same proportion, and this property is also sufficient to establish similarity.\\nsome basic theorems about similar triangles are:\\n\\nif and only if one pair of internal angles of two triangles have the same measure as each other, and another pair also have the same measure as each other, the triangles are similar.\\nif and only if one pair of corresponding sides of two triangles are in the same proportion as are another pair of corresponding sides, and their included angles have the same measure, then the triangles are similar. (the included angle for any two sides of a polygon is the internal angle between those two sides.)\\nif and only if three pairs of corresponding sides of two triangles are all in the same proportion, then the triangles are similar.two triangles that are congruent have exactly the same size and shape: all pairs of corresponding interior angles are equal in measure, and all pairs of corresponding sides have the same length. (this is a total of six equalities, but three are often sufficient to prove congruence.)\\nsome individually necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of triangles to be congruent are:\\n\\nsas postulate: two sides in a triangle have the same length as two sides in the other triangle, and the included angles have the same measure.\\nasa: two interior angles and the included side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (the included side for a pair of angles is the side that is common to them.)\\nsss: each side of a triangle has the same length as a corresponding side of the other triangle.\\naas: two angles and a corresponding (non-included) side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (this is sometimes referred to as aacorrs and then includes asa above.)some individually sufficient conditions are:\\n\\nhypotenuse-leg (hl) theorem: the hypotenuse and a leg in a right triangle have the same length as those in another right triangle. this is also called rhs (right-angle, hypotenuse, side).\\nhypotenuse-angle theorem: the hypotenuse and an acute angle in one right triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in the other right triangle. this is just a particular case of the aas theorem.an important condition is:\\n\\nside-side-angle (or angle-side-side) condition: if two sides and a corresponding non-included angle of a triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in another triangle, then this is not sufficient to prove congruence; but if the angle given is opposite to the longer side of the two sides, then the triangles are congruent. the hypotenuse-leg theorem is a particular case of this criterion. the side-side-angle condition does not by itself guarantee that the triangles are congruent because one triangle could be obtuse-angled and the other acute-angled.using right triangles and the concept of similarity, the trigonometric functions sine and cosine can be defined. these are functions of an angle which are investigated in trigonometry.\\n\\n\\n=== right triangles ===\\n\\na central theorem is the pythagorean theorem, which states in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two other sides. if the hypotenuse has length c, and the legs have lengths a and b, then the theorem states that\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          a\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n

have the same length, then the angles opposite those legs have the same measure. since these angles are complementary, it follows that each measures 45 degrees. by the pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is the length of a leg times √2.\\nin a right triangle with acute angles measuring 30 and 60 degrees, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter side, and the longer side is

condition on the sides ===\\nthe triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. that sum can equal the length of the third side only in the case of a degenerate triangle, one with collinear vertices. it is not possible for that sum to be less than the length of the third side. a triangle with three given positive side lengths exists if and only if those side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.\\n\\n\\n=== conditions on the angles ===\\nthree given angles form a non-degenerate triangle (and indeed an infinitude of them) if and only if both of these conditions hold: (a) each of the angles is positive, and (b) the angles sum to 180°. if degenerate triangles are permitted, angles of 0° are permitted.\\n\\n\\n==== trigonometric conditions ====\\nthree positive angles α, β, and γ, each of them less than 180°, are the angles of a triangle if and only if any one of the following conditions

associated with a triangle ==\\nthere are thousands of different constructions that find a special point associated with (and often inside) a triangle, satisfying some unique property: see the article encyclopedia of triangle centers for a catalogue of them. often they are constructed by finding three lines associated in a symmetrical way with the three sides (or vertices) and then proving that the three lines meet in a single point: an important tool for proving the existence of these is ceva\\'s theorem, which gives a criterion for determining when three such lines are concurrent. similarly, lines associated with a triangle are often constructed by proving that three symmetrically constructed points are collinear: here menelaus\\' theorem gives a useful general criterion. in this section just a few of the most commonly encountered constructions are explained.\\n\\na perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is a straight line passing through the midpoint of the side and being perpendicular to it, i.e. forming a right angle with it. the three perpendicular bisectors meet in a single point, the triangle\\'s circumcenter, usually denoted by o; this point is the center of the circumcircle, the circle passing through all three vertices. the diameter of this circle, called the circumdiameter, can be found from the law of sines stated above. the circumcircle\\'s radius is called the circumradius.\\nthales\\' theorem implies that if the circumcenter is located on a side of the triangle, then the opposite angle is a right one. if the circumcenter is located inside the triangle, then the triangle is acute; if the circumcenter is located outside the triangle, then the triangle is obtuse.\\n\\nan altitude of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and perpendicular to (i.e. forming a right angle with) the opposite side. this opposite side is called the base of the altitude, and the point where the altitude intersects the base (or its extension) is called the foot of the altitude. the length of the altitude is the distance between the base and the vertex. the three altitudes intersect in a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle, usually denoted by h. the orthocenter lies inside the triangle if and only if the triangle is acute.\\n\\nan angle bisector of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex which cuts the corresponding angle in half. the three angle bisectors intersect in a single point, the incenter, usually denoted by i, the center of the triangle\\'s incircle. the incircle is the circle which lies inside the triangle and touches all three sides. its radius is called the inradius. there are three other important circles, the excircles; they lie outside the triangle and touch one side as well as the extensions of the other two. the centers of the in- and excircles form an orthocentric system.\\n\\na median of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, and divides the triangle into two equal areas. the three medians intersect in a single point, the triangle\\'s centroid or geometric barycenter, usually denoted by g. the centroid of a rigid triangular object (cut out of a thin sheet of uniform density) is also its center of mass: the object can be balanced on its centroid in a uniform gravitational field. the centroid cuts every median in the ratio 2:1, i.e. the distance between a vertex and the centroid is twice the distance between the centroid and the midpoint of the opposite side.\\n\\nthe midpoints of the three sides and the feet of the three altitudes all lie on a single circle, the triangle\\'s nine-point circle. the remaining three points for which it is named are the midpoints of the portion of altitude between the vertices and the orthocenter. the radius of the nine-point circle is half that of the circumcircle. it touches the incircle (at the feuerbach point) and the three excircles.\\n\\nthe orthocenter (blue point), center of the nine-point circle (red), centroid (orange), and circumcenter (green) all lie on a single line, known as euler\\'s line (red line). the center of the nine-point circle lies at the midpoint between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and the distance between the centroid and the circumcenter is half that between the centroid and the orthocenter.\\nthe center of the incircle is not in general located on euler\\'s line.\\nif one reflects a median in the angle bisector that passes through the same vertex, one obtains a symmedian. the three symmedians intersect in a single point, the symmedian point of the triangle.\\n\\n\\n== computing the sides and angles ==\\nthere are various standard methods for calculating the length of a side or the measure of an angle. certain methods are suited to calculating values in a right-angled triangle; more complex methods may be required in other situations.\\n\\n\\n=== trigonometric ratios in right triangles ===\\n\\nin right triangles, the trigonometric ratios of sine, cosine and tangent can be used to find unknown angles and the lengths of unknown sides. the sides of the triangle are known as follows:\\n\\nthe hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, or defined as the longest side of a right-angled triangle, in this case h.\\nthe opposite side is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in, in this case a.\\nthe adjacent side is the side that is in contact with the angle we are interested in and the right angle, hence its name. in this case the adjacent side is b.\\n\\n\\n==== sine, cosine and

ratio is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the given triangle. another interpretation of this theorem is that every triangle with angles α, β and γ is similar to a triangle with side lengths equal to sin α, sin β and sin γ. this triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. the length of the sides of that triangle will be sin α, sin β and sin γ. the side whose length is sin α is opposite to the angle whose measure is α, etc.\\nthe law of cosines, or cosine rule, connects the length of an

 \\n\\n\\n=== using line integrals ===\\nthe area within any closed curve, such as a triangle, is given by the line integral around the curve of the algebraic or signed distance of a point on the curve from an arbitrary oriented straight line l. points to the right of l as oriented are taken to be at negative distance from l, while the weight for the integral is taken to be the component of arc length parallel to l rather than arc length itself.\\nthis method is well suited to computation of the area of an arbitrary polygon. taking l to be the x-axis, the line integral between consecutive vertices (xi,yi) and (xi+1,yi+1) is given by the base times the mean height, namely (xi+1 − xi)(yi + yi+1)/2. the sign of the area is an overall indicator of the direction of traversal, with negative area indicating counterclockwise traversal. the area of a triangle then falls out as the case of a polygon with three sides.\\nwhile the line integral method has in common with other coordinate-based methods the arbitrary choice of a coordinate system, unlike the others it makes no arbitrary choice of vertex of the triangle as origin or of side as base. furthermore, the choice of coordinate system defined by l commits to only two degrees of freedom rather than the usual three, since the weight is a local distance (e.g. xi+1 − xi in the above) whence the method does not require choosing an axis normal to l.\\nwhen working in polar coordinates it is not necessary to convert to cartesian coordinates to use line integration, since the line integral between consecutive vertices (ri,θi) and (ri+1,θi+1) of a polygon is given directly by riri+1sin(θi+1 − θi)/2. this is valid for all values of θ, with some decrease in numerical accuracy when |θ| is many orders of magnitude greater than π. with this formulation negative area indicates clockwise traversal, which should be kept in mind when mixing polar and cartesian coordinates. just as the choice of y-axis (x = 0) is immaterial for line integration in cartesian coordinates, so is the choice of zero heading (θ = 0) immaterial here.\\n\\n\\n=== formulas resembling heron\\'s formula ===\\nthree formulas have the same

at most equal to 2t. equality holds (exclusively) for a parallelogram.\\n\\n\\n=== hexagon ===\\nthe lemoine hexagon is a cyclic hexagon with vertices given by the six intersections of the sides of a triangle with the three lines that are parallel to the sides and that pass through its symmedian point. in either its simple form or its self-intersecting form, the lemoine hexagon is interior to the triangle with two vertices on each side of the triangle.\\n\\n\\n=== squares ===\\nevery acute triangle has three inscribed squares (squares in its interior such that all four of a square\\'s vertices lie on a side of the triangle, so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle). in a right triangle two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangle\\'s right angle, so a right triangle has only two distinct inscribed squares. an obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle\\'s longest side.  within a given triangle, a longer common side is associated with a smaller inscribed square. if an inscribed square has side of length qa and the triangle has a side of length a, part of which side coincides with a side of the square, then qa, a, the altitude ha from the side a, and the triangle\\'s area t are related according to\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n

triangles ===\\nfrom an interior point in a reference triangle, the nearest points on the three sides serve as the vertices of the pedal triangle of that point. if the interior point is the circumcenter of the reference triangle, the vertices of the pedal triangle are the midpoints of the reference triangle\\'s sides, and so the pedal triangle is called the midpoint triangle or medial triangle. the midpoint triangle subdivides the reference triangle into four congruent triangles which are similar to the reference triangle.\\nthe gergonne triangle or intouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the three points of tangency of the reference triangle\\'s sides with its incircle. the extouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the points of tangency of the reference triangle\\'s excircles with its sides (not extended).\\n\\n\\n== figures circumscribed about a triangle ==\\nthe tangential triangle of a reference triangle (other than a right triangle) is the triangle whose sides are on the tangent lines to the reference triangle\\'s circumcircle at its vertices.\\nas mentioned above, every triangle has a unique circumcircle, a circle passing through all three vertices, whose center is the intersection of the  perpendicular bisectors of the triangle\\'s sides.\\nfurther, every triangle has a unique steiner circumellipse, which passes through the triangle\\'s vertices and has its center at the triangle\\'s centroid. of all ellipses going through the triangle\\'s vertices, it has the smallest area.\\nthe kiepert hyperbola is the unique conic which passes through the triangle\\'s three vertices, its centroid, and its circumcenter.\\nof all triangles contained in a given convex polygon, there exists a triangle with maximal area whose vertices are all vertices of the given polygon.\\n\\n\\n== specifying the location of a point in a triangle ==\\none way to identify locations of points in (or outside) a triangle is to place the triangle in an arbitrary location and orientation in the cartesian plane, and to use cartesian coordinates. while convenient for many purposes, this approach has the disadvantage of all points\\' coordinate values being dependent on the arbitrary placement in the plane.\\ntwo systems avoid that feature, so that the coordinates of a point are not affected by moving the triangle, rotating it, or reflecting it as in a mirror, any of which give a congruent triangle, or even by rescaling it to give a similar triangle:\\n\\ntrilinear coordinates specify the relative distances of a point from the sides, so that coordinates \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        :\\n        y\\n        :\\n        z\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x:y:z}\\n   indicate that the ratio

  specify the point\\'s location by the relative weights that would have to be put on the three vertices in order to balance the otherwise weightless triangle on the given point.\\n\\n\\n== non-planar triangles ==\\na non-planar triangle is a triangle which is not contained in a (flat) plane. some examples of non-planar triangles in non-euclidean geometries are spherical triangles in spherical geometry and hyperbolic triangles in hyperbolic geometry.\\nwhile the measures of the internal angles in planar triangles always sum to 180°, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180°, and a spherical triangle has measures of angles that sum to more than 180°. a hyperbolic triangle can be obtained by drawing on a negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface, and a spherical triangle can be obtained by drawing on a positively curved surface such as a sphere. thus, if one draws a giant triangle on the surface of the earth, one will find that the sum of the measures of its angles is greater than 180°; in fact it will be between 180° and 540°. in particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles is equal to 90°, adding up to a total of 270°.\\nspecifically, on a sphere the sum of the angles of a triangle is\\n\\n180° × (1 + 4f),where f is the fraction of the sphere\\'s area which is enclosed by the triangle. for example, suppose that we draw a triangle on the earth\\'s surface with vertices at the north pole, at a point on the equator at 0° longitude, and a point on the equator at 90° west longitude. the great circle line between the latter two points is the equator, and the great circle line between either of those points and the north pole is a line of longitude; so there are right angles at the two points on the equator. moreover, the angle at the north pole is also 90° because the other two vertices differ by 90° of longitude. so the sum of the angles in this triangle is 90° + 90° + 90° = 270°. the triangle encloses 1/4 of the northern hemisphere (90°/360° as viewed from the north pole) and therefore 1/8 of the earth\\'s surface, so in the formula f = 1/8; thus the formula correctly gives the sum of the triangle\\'s angles as 270°.\\nfrom the above angle sum formula we can also see that the earth\\'s surface is locally flat: if we draw an arbitrarily small triangle in the neighborhood of one point on the earth\\'s surface, the fraction f of the earth\\'s surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily close to zero. in this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we know is what euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.\\n\\n\\n== triangles in construction ==\\n\\nrectangles have been the most popular and common geometric form for buildings since the shape is easy to stack and organize; as a standard, it is easy to design furniture and fixtures to fit inside rectangularly shaped buildings. but triangles, while more difficult to use conceptually, provide a great deal of strength. as computer technology helps architects design creative new buildings, triangular shapes are becoming increasingly prevalent as parts of buildings and as the primary shape for some types of skyscrapers as well as building materials. in tokyo in 1989, architects had wondered whether it was possible to build a 500-story tower to provide affordable office space for this densely packed city, but with the danger to buildings from earthquakes, architects considered that a triangular shape would be necessary if such a building were to be built.in new york city, as broadway crisscrosses major avenues, the resulting blocks are cut like triangles, and buildings have been built on these shapes; one such building is the triangularly shaped flatiron building which real estate people admit has a \"warren of awkward spaces that do not easily accommodate modern office furniture\" but that has not prevented the structure from becoming a landmark icon. designers have made houses in norway using triangular themes. triangle shapes have appeared in churches as well as public buildings including colleges as well as supports for innovative home designs.triangles are sturdy; while a rectangle can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure to one of its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. a triangle will not change shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, each of the three sides supports the other two. a rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. it is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. it is important to remember that triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\n\\n== notes ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\n\\n\\n== external links ==\\nivanov, a.b.

              "       ['the early modern period of modern history follows the late middle ages of the post-classical era. although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the timeframe spans the period after the late portion of the post-classical age (c. 1500), known as the middle ages, through the beginning of the age of revolutions (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the fall of constantinople in 1453, the renaissance period in europe, the muslim conquests in the indian subcontinent, and the age of discovery (especially the voyages of christopher columbus beginning in 1492 but also with vasco da gama\\'s discovery of the sea route to india in 1498) and ending around the french revolution in 1789.\\nhistorians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its globalizing character. new economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. this process began in the medieval north italian city-states, particularly genoa, venice, and milan in the west, and in india\\'s bengal in the east. the early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. \\nin the americas, pre-columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the aztec empire and alliance, the inca civilization, the maya civilization and  its cities, and the chibcha. the european colonization of the americas began during the early modern period, as did the establishment of european trading hubs in asia and africa, which contributed to the spread of christianity around the world. the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe, in particular the columbian exchange that linked the old world and the new world, greatly altered the human environment. notably, the atlantic slave trade and the genocide of native american peoples began during this period.  turkey colonized southeastern europe, and parts of the west asia and north africa. russia reached the pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the russian far east in the 19th century.\\nin the islamic world, the ghurid dynasty, delhi sultanate, and the ottoman, suri, safavid, and mughal empires grew in strength (three of which are known as gunpowder empires for the military technology that enabled them). particularly in the indian subcontinent, mughal architecture, culture, and art reached their zenith, while the empire itself is believed to have had the world\\'s largest economy, bigger than the entirety of western europe and worth 25% of global gdp, signalling the period of proto-industrialization. later religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned muslim expansion. \\nvarious chinese dynasties and japanese shogunates controlled the asian sphere. in japan, the edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. in korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the joseon dynasty to the enthronement of king gojong. by the 16th century, asian economies under the ming dynasty and mughal bengal were stimulated by trade with the portuguese, the spanish, and the dutch, while japan engaged in the nanban trade after the arrival of the first european portuguese during the azuchi–momoyama period.\\nthe early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. feudalism declined in europe, and christians and christendom saw the end of the crusades and of religious unity under the roman catholic church. the old order was destabilized by the protestant reformation, which caused a backlash that expanded the inquisition and sparked the disastrous european wars of religion, which included the especially bloody thirty years\\' war and ended with the establishment of the modern international system in the peace of westphalia. along with the european colonization of the americas, this period also contained the commercial revolution and the golden age of piracy.\\nother notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, and the emergence of nation states. historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the french revolution of the 1790s began the \"late modern\" period.the indian empires and civilizations of southeast asia, mainly the major trading nation known as the bengal sultanate, were a vital link in the spice trade. the mughal empire was founded by the descendants of tamerlane and its architecture has impressed the world. the archipelagic empires, the sultanate of malacca and later the sultanate of johor, controlled the southern areas.\\n\\n\\n== early modern timeline ==\\n\\ndates are approximate. consult particular article for details.\\n         early modern themes      other\\n\\n\\n== significant events

modes.\\nas an age of revolutions dawned, beginning with those revolts in america and france, political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the napoleonic wars and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.the early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of mechanization in society, the american revolution, the first french revolution; other factors included the redrawing of the map of europe by the final act of the congress of vienna and the peace established by second treaty of paris which ended the napoleonic wars.\\n\\n\\n== east asia ==\\nin early modern times, the major nations of east asia attempted to pursue a course of isolationism from the outside world but this policy was not always enforced uniformly or successfully. however, by the end of the early modern period, china, korea and japan were mostly closed and disinterested to europeans, even while trading relationships grew in port cities such as guangzhou and dejima. \\n\\n\\n=== chinese dynasties ===\\n\\naround the beginning of the ethnically han ming dynasty (1368–1644), china was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. however, europe soon caught up to china\\'s scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them. many scholars have speculated about the reason behind china\\'s lag in advancement. a historian named colin ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between china\\'s urgency for new discoveries being weaker than europe\\'s and china\\'s inability to capitalize on its early advantages. ronan believes that china\\'s confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to china not having a scientific revolution, which led china to have fewer scientists to break the existing orthodoxies, like galileo galilei. despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. china was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the portuguese brought their matchlocks to japan in the early 1500s. china during the ming dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. the bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.\\n\\nin the early ming dynasty, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. large urban centers, such as nanjing and beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. in particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. for the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.\\nin the 16th century the ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the portuguese, spanish and dutch empires. the trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which china at the time needed desperately. prior to china\\'s global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. however, in the 14th century, china\\'s paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed. the silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in china was twice as high as the value of silver in spain during the end of the 16th century.with the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-confucianism, china under the later ming dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels. despite isolationist policies the ming economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of spanish new world silver entering its economy through new european colonies such as macao. ming china was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect korea from japanese invasion.  the european trade depression of the 1620s also hurt the chinese economy, which sunk to the point where all of china\\'s trading partners cut ties with them: philip iv restricted shipments of exports from acapulco, the japanese cut off all trade with macau, and the dutch severed connections between gao and macau.the damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient little ice age, natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. the ensuing breakdown of authority and people\\'s livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as li zicheng, to challenge ming authority.\\n\\nthe ming dynasty fell around 1644 to the ethnically manchu qing dynasty, which would be the last dynasty of china. the qing ruled from 1644 to 1912, with a brief, abortive restoration in 1917. during its reign, the qing dynasty adopted many of the outward features of chinese culture in establishing its rule, but did not necessarily \"assimilate\", instead adopting a more universalist style of governance. the manchus were formerly known as the jurchens. when beijing was captured by li zicheng\\'s peasant rebels in 1644, the chongzhen emperor, the last ming emperor, committed suicide. the manchus then allied with former ming general wu sangui and seized control of beijing, which became the new capital of the qing dynasty. the manchus adopted the confucian norms of traditional chinese government in their rule of china proper. schoppa, the editor of the columbia guide to modern chinese history argues, \"a date around 1780 as the beginning of modern china is thus closer to what we know today as historical \\'reality\\'. it also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\"\\n\\n\\n=== japanese shogunates ===\\n\\nthe sengoku period that began around 1467 and lasted until around 1600 consisted of several continually \"warring states\".\\nfollowing contact with the portuguese on tanegashima isle in 1543, the japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the arquebus, european-style cuirasses, european ships), religion (christianity), decorative art, language (integration to japanese of a western vocabulary) and culinary: the portuguese introduced tempura and valuable refined sugar.\\ncentral government was largely reestablished by oda nobunaga and toyotomi hideyoshi during the azuchi–momoyama period. although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with oda nobunaga\\'s entry into kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install ashikaga yoshiaki as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the ashikaga shogunate, and it lasts until the coming to power of tokugawa ieyasu after his victory over supporters of the toyotomi clan at the battle of sekigahara in 1600. tokugawa received the title of shōgun in 1603, establishing the tokugawa shogunate.\\nthe edo period from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern japan. the tokugawa shogunate was a feudalist regime of japan established by tokugawa ieyasu and ruled by the shōguns of the tokugawa clan. the period gets its name from the capital city, edo, now called tokyo. the tokugawa shogunate ruled from edo castle from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the meiji restoration in the late edo period (often called the late tokugawa shogunate).\\nsociety in the japanese \"tokugawa period\" (edo society), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by toyotomi hideyoshi. the daimyōs (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. the country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the sakoku policy. literacy among the japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.in some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, daimyōs and samurai were more or less identical, since daimyōs might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. as a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. this often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. none, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.\\n\\n\\n=== korean dynasty ===\\nin 1392, general yi seong-gye established the joseon dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. yi seong-gye moved the capital of korea to the location of modern-day seoul. the dynasty was heavily influenced by confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping korea\\'s strong cultural identity. king sejong the great (1418–1450), one of the only two kings in korea\\'s history to earn the title of great in their posthumous titles, reclaimed korean territory to the north and created the korean alphabet.\\nduring the end of the 16th century, korea was invaded twice by japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. japan failed both times due to admiral yi sun-sin, korea\\'s revered naval genius, who lead the korean navy using advanced metal clad ships called turtle ships. because the ships were armed with cannons, admiral yi\\'s navy was able to demolish the japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in japan\\'s second invasion. during the 17th century, korea was invaded again, this time by manchurians, who would later take over china as the qing dynasty. in 1637, king injo was forced to surrender to the qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubines to the qing prince dorgon.after invasions from manchuria, joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. however, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. the joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\\n\\n\\n== indian empires ==\\n\\n\\n=== regional empires ===\\n\\non the indian subcontinent, the lodi dynasty ruled over the delhi sultanate during its last phase. the dynasty founded by bahlul lodi ruled from 1451 to 1526. the dynasty\\'s last ruler, ibrahim lodhi, was defeated and killed by babur in the first battle of panipat.\\nthe vijayanagara empire was based in the deccan plateau, but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the deccan sultanates. the empire is named after its capital city of vijayanagara.\\nthe rise of the great mughal empire is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the middle ages. it was an islamic persianate imperial power that ruled most of the area as hindustan by the late 17th and the early 18th centuries. the empire dominated south and southwestern asia,\\nbecoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing power, with a nominal gdp that valued a quarter of world gdp, superior than the combination of europe\\'s gdp.\\nthe \"classic period\" ended with the death of mughal emperor aurangzeb, although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. during this period, the empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. all the significant monuments of the mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of persian cultural influence in the indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. the maratha empire was located in the south west of present-day india and expanded greatly under the rule of the peshwas, the prime ministers of the maratha empire. in 1761, the maratha army lost the third battle of panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of maratha states.\\n\\n\\n=== british and dutch colonization ===\\nthe development of new imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. the commercial colonization of india commenced in 1757, after the battle of plassey, when the nawab of bengal surrendered his dominions to the british east india company, in 1765, when the company was granted the diwani, or the right to collect revenue, in bengal and bihar, or in 1772, when the company established a capital in calcutta, appointed its first governor-general, warren hastings, and became directly involved in governance.\\n\\nthe maratha states, following the anglo-maratha wars, eventually lost to the british east india company in 1818 with the third anglo-maratha war. the rule lasted until 1858, when, after the indian rebellion of 1857 and consequent of the government of india act 1858, the british government assumed the task of directly administering india in the new british raj. in 1819 stamford raffles established singapore as a key trading post for britain in their rivalry with the dutch. however, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an anglo-dutch treaty demarcated their respective interests in southeast asia. from the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.\\nthe dutch east india company (1800) and british east india company (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. only thailand was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the western powers. colonial rule had a profound effect on southeast asia. while the colonial powers profited much from the region\\'s vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.\\n\\n\\n== southeast asia ==\\nat the start of the modern era, the spice route between india and china crossed majapahit,  an archipelagic empire based on the island of java. it was the last of the major hindu empires of maritime southeast asia and is considered one of the greatest states in indonesian history. its influence extended to states in sumatra, the malay peninsula, borneo and eastern indonesia, but the effectiveness of the influence is the subject of debate. majapahit found itself unable to control the rising power of the sultanate of malacca, which grew to stretch from muslim malay settlements of bukit (phuket), setol (satun), pantai ni (pattani) bordering ayutthaya kingdom of siam (thailand) in the north to sumatra in the southwest. the portuguese invaded its capital in 1511 and in 1528 the sultanate of johor was established by a malaccan prince to succeed malacca.\\n\\n\\n== near east and afro-asiatic africa ==\\n\\n\\n=== ottoman empire ===\\n\\nduring the early modern era, the ottoman state enjoyed an expansion and consolidation of power, leading to a pax ottomana. this was perhaps the golden age of the ottoman empire. the ottomans expanded southwest into north africa while battling with the re-emergent persian shi\\'a safavid empire to the east.\\n\\n\\n=== north and northeast africa ===\\nin the saracen sphere, the ottomans seized egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of algeria, tunisia, and tripoli (between 1519 and 1551), morocco remaining an independent arabized berber state under the sharifan dynasty.\\n\\nin the ethiopian highlands, the solomonic dynasty established itself in the 13th century. claiming direct descent from the old axumite royal house, the solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. in the 16th century, shewa and the rest of abyssinia were conquered by the forces of ahmed gurey of the adal sultanate to the northwest. the conquest of the area by the oromo ended in the contraction of both adal and abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.\\nthe ajuran empire, which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the horn of africa, began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. the geledi sultanate, established by ibrahim adeer, was a notable successor of the ajuran sultanate. the sultanate reached its apex under the successive reigns of sultan yusuf mahamud ibrahim (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated geledi power during the bardera wars, and sultan ahmed yusuf, who forced regional powers such as the omani empire to pay tribute. the majeerteen sultanate was a somali sultanate in the horn of africa. ruled by king osman mahamuud during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. the polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. along with the sultanate of hobyo ruled by sultan yusuf ali kenadid, the majeerteen sultanate was eventually annexed into italian somaliland in the early 20th century, following the military campaign of the sultanates.\\n\\n\\n=== safavids ===\\n\\nthe safavid empire was a great shia persianate empire after the islamic conquest of persia and established of islam, marking an important point in the history of islam in the east. the safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. from their base in ardabil, the safavids established control over all of persia and reasserted the iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the sassanids to establish a unified iranian state. problematic for the safavids was the powerful ottoman empire. the ottomans, a sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the safavids.\\nwhat fueled the growth of safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of europe to its west and islamic central asia to its east and north. the silk road, which led from europe to east asia, revived in the 16th century. leaders also supported direct sea trade with europe, particularly england and the netherlands, which sought persian carpet, silk, and textiles. other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in india. the main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from europe, cotton from gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. despite their demise in 1722, the safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading shi\\'a islam in major parts of the caucasus and west asia.\\n\\n\\n=== uzbeks and afghan pashtuns ===\\n\\nin the 16th to early 18th centuries, central asia was under the rule of uzbeks, and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local pashtuns. between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the kipchaks, naymans, kanglis, khongirad, and manguds. these groups were led by muhammad shaybani, who was the khan of the uzbeks.\\nthe lineage of the afghan pashtuns stretches back to the hotaki dynasty. following muslim arab and turkic conquests, pashtun ghazis (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern india during the lodhi dynasty and suri dynasty. pashtun forces also invaded persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in the battle of gulnabad. the pashtuns later formed the durrani empire.\\n\\n\\n== europe ==\\n\\nmany major events caused europe to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the fall of constantinople in 1453, the fall of muslim spain and the discovery of the americas in 1492, and martin luther\\'s protestant reformation in 1517. in england the modern period is often dated to the start of the tudor period with the victory of henry vii over richard iii at the battle of bosworth in 1485. early modern european history is usually seen to span from the start of the 15th century, through the age of enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the industrial revolution in the late 18th century.\\nthe early modern period is taken to end with the french revolution, the napoleonic wars, and the dissolution of the holy roman empire at the congress of vienna.\\nat the end of the early modern period, the british and russian empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of colonial empires, while the three great asian empires of the early modern period, ottoman turkey, mughal india and qing china, all entered a period of stagnation or decline.\\n\\n\\n=== renaissance vs. early modern period ===\\nthe expression \"early modern\" is at times used as a substitute for the term renaissance. however, \"renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of europe—especially central and northern italy—and it spans the transition from late medieval civilization to the opening of the early modern period. in the visual arts and architecture, the term \"early modern\" is not a common designation as the renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. european music of the period is generally divided between renaissance and baroque. similarly, philosophy is divided between renaissance philosophy and the enlightenment. in other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as warfare and science.\\n\\n\\n=== gunpowder and firearms ===\\nwhen gunpowder was introduced to europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. though it was invented in china, gunpowder arrived in europe already formulated for military use and european countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms. the advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.\\n\\n\\n=== european kingdoms and movements ===\\nin the early modern period, the holy roman empire was a union of territories in central europe under a holy roman emperor the first of which was otto i. the last was francis ii, who abdicated and dissolved the empire in 1806 during the napoleonic wars. despite its name, for much of its history the empire did not include rome within its borders.\\nthe renaissance was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in italy in the late middle ages and later spreading to the rest of europe. the term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic era, but since the changes of the renaissance were not uniform across europe, this is a general use of the term. as a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on classical sources, the development of linear perspective in painting, and gradual but widespread educational reform.\\n\\n\\n==== notable individuals ====\\n\\njohannes gutenberg is credited as the first european to use movable type printing, around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical printing press. nicolaus copernicus formulated a comprehensive heliocentric cosmology (1543), which displaced the earth from the center of the universe. his book, de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions of the celestial spheres) began modern astronomy and sparked the scientific revolution. another notable individual was machiavelli, an italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern political science. machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, the prince, a work of realist political theory.\\namong the notable royalty of the time, charles the bold, known as charles the bold (or rash) to his enemies, he was the last valois duke of burgundy, and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in european history. charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit—a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. upon his death, charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, mary of burgundy, as his heir. her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of europe. the habsburg emperor secured the match for his son, the future maximilian i, holy roman emperor, with the aid of mary\\'s stepmother, margaret. in 1477, the territory of the duchy of burgundy was annexed by france. in the same year, mary married maximilian, archduke of austria, giving the habsburgs control of the remainder of the burgundian inheritance.\\n\\nclaude de lorraine was the first duke of guise, from 1528 to his death. claude distinguished himself at the battle of marignano (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. in 1521, he fought at fuenterrabia, and louise of savoy ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. in 1523 he became governor of champagne and burgundy, after defeating at neufchâteau the imperial troops who had invaded this province. in 1525 he destroyed the anabaptist peasant army, which was overrunning lorraine, at lupstein, near saverne (zabern). on the return of francis i from captivity in 1528, claude was made duke of guise in the peerage of france, though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of france. the guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of lorraine and descendants of the house of anjou, claimed precedence of the bourbon princes of condé and conti.\\nthe 3rd duke of alba was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the \"iron duke\" by the protestants of the low countries because of his harsh rule and cruelty. tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in flanders became part of dutch and english folklore, forming a central component of the spanish black legend.\\nin england, henry viii was the king of england and a significant figure in the history of the english monarchy. although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the protestant reformation in england, a movement having some roots with john wycliffe in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with rome. these struggles ultimately led to the separation of the church of england from papal authority, the dissolution of the monasteries, and establishing himself as the supreme head of the church of england. though henry reportedly became a protestant on his death-bed, he advocated catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. royal support for the english reformation began with his heirs, the devout edward vi and the renowned elizabeth i, whilst daughter mary i temporarily reinstated papal authority over england. henry also oversaw the legal union of england and wales with the laws in wales acts 1535–1542. he is also noted for his six wives, two of whom were beheaded.\\n\\n\\n=== christians and christendom ===\\n\\nchristianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the fall of constantinople in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including lutheran, zwinglian, and calvinist), followed by the counter reformation.\\n\\n\\n==== end of the crusades and unity ====\\n\\nthe hussite crusades involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of jan hus in bohemia ending ultimately with the battle of grotniki. also known as the hussite wars, they were arguably the first european war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as muskets made a decisive contribution. the taborite faction of the hussite warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. in totality, the hussite crusades were inconclusive.\\nthe last crusade, the crusade of 1456, was organized to counter the expanding ottoman empire and lift the siege of belgrade, and was led by john hunyadi and giovanni da capistrano. the siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded sultan mehmet ii to lift the siege and retreat. the siege of belgrade has been characterized as having \"decided the fate of christendom\". the noon bell ordered by pope callixtus iii commemorates the victory throughout the christian world to this day.\\nnearly a hundred years later, the peace of augsburg officially ended the idea that all christians could be united under one church. the principle of cuius regio, eius religio (\"whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion\") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of christianity, and this was established in international law with the treaty of westphalia in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single christian hegemony, i.e. the \"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church\" of the nicene creed. each government determined the religion of their own state. christians living in states where their denomination was not the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. with the treaty of westphalia, the wars of religion came to an end, and in the treaty of utrecht of 1713 the concept of the sovereign national state was born. the corpus christianum has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.\\n\\n\\n==== inquisitions and reformations ====\\n\\nthe modern inquisition refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting heretics (or other offenders against canon law) within the catholic church. in the modern era, the first manifestation was the spanish inquisition of 1478 to 1834. the inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including sorcery, blasphemy, judaizing and witchcraft, as well for censorship of printed literature. because of its objective—combating heresy—the inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in catholic countries). secular courts could still try non-christians for blasphemy (most of the witch trials went through secular courts).\\nthe protestant reformation and rise of modernity in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the corpus christianum. martin luther challenged the catholic church with his ninety-five theses, generally accepted as the beginning of the reformation, a christian reform movement in europe, though precursors such as jan hus predate him. the protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the electorate of saxony, an independent hereditary electorate of the holy roman empire. the elector frederick iii established a university at wittenberg in 1502. the augustinian monk martin luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. at the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of wittenberg.\\non 31 october 1517, luther posted his ninety-five theses on the door of the all saints\\' church, which served as a notice board for university-related announcements. these were points for debate that criticized the church and the pope. the most controversial points centered on the practice of selling indulgences (especially by johann tetzel) and the church\\'s policy on purgatory. the reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival protestant churches. the most important denominations to emerge directly from the reformation were the lutherans, and the reformed/calvinists/presbyterians. the process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. in england, where it gave rise to anglicanism, the period became known as the english reformation. subsequent protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.\\nthe diet of worms in 1521, presided by emperor charles v, declared martin luther a heretic and an outlaw (although charles v  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting luther). as a result of charles v\\'s distractions in east europe and in spain, he agreed through the diet of speyer in 1526 to allow german princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the edict of worms or not, for the time being. after returning to the empire, charles v attended the diet of augsburg in 1530 to order all protestants in the empire to revert to catholicism. in response, the protestant territories in and around germany formed the schmalkaldic league to fight against the catholic holy roman empire. charles v left again to handle the advance of the ottoman turks. he returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the schmalkaldic league and to issue an imperial law requiring all protestants to return to catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to protestant practices). warfare ended when charles v relented in the peace of passau (1552) and in the peace of augsburg (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.\\nof the late inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:\\nthe portuguese inquisition (1536–1821)\\nthe roman inquisition (1542 – c.1860)this portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous spanish inquisition. the roman inquisition covered most of the italian peninsula as well as malta and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of europe, including avignon.\\nthe catholic reformation began in 1545 when the council of trent was called in reaction to the protestant rebellion. the idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the clergy of the church, while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the catholic church and its position as the sole true church of christ on earth. the effort sought to prevent further damage to the church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed protestant denominations.\\n\\n\\n==== tsardom of russia ====\\n\\nin development of the third rome ideas, the grand duke ivan iv (the \"awesome\" or \"the terrible\") was officially crowned the first tsar (\"caesar\") of russia in 1547. the tsar promulgated a new code of laws (sudebnik of 1550), established the first russian feudal representative body (zemsky sobor) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions. during his long reign, ivan iv nearly doubled the already large russian territory by annexing the three tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated golden horde): kazan and astrakhan along the volga river, and sibirean khanate in south western siberia. thus by the end of the 16th century russia was transformed into a multiethnic, multiconfessional and transcontinental state.\\nrussia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of cossacks. cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the new world. the native land of the cossacks is defined by a line of russian/ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the steppe and stretching from the middle volga to ryazan and tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the dnieper via pereyaslavl. this area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.\\n\\nin 1648, the peasants of ukraine joined the zaporozhian cossacks in rebellion against poland-lithuania during the khmelnytsky uprising, because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under polish rule. in 1654 the ukrainian leader, bohdan khmelnytsky, offered to place ukraine under the protection of the russian tsar, aleksey i. aleksey\\'s acceptance of this offer led to another russo-polish war (1654–1667). finally, ukraine was split along the river dnieper, leaving the western part (or right-bank ukraine) under polish rule and eastern part (left-bank ukraine and kiev) under russian. later, in 1670–71 the don cossacks led by stenka razin initiated a major uprising in the volga region, but the tsar\\'s troops were successful in defeating the rebels. in the east, the rapid russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of siberia was led mostly by cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the siberian river routes, and by the mid-17th century there were russian settlements in the eastern siberia, on the chukchi peninsula, along the amur river, and on the pacific coast. in 1648 the bering strait between asia and north america was passed for the first time by fedot popov and semyon dezhnyov.\\n\\n\\n=== discovery and trade ===\\n\\nthe age of discovery was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which european ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in europe. they also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and spices. in the process, europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. this factor in the early european modern period was a globalizing character; the \\'discovery\\' of the americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.\\nthe search for new routes was based on the fact that the silk road was controlled by the ottoman empire, which was an impediment to european commercial interests, and other eastern trade routes were not available to the europeans due to muslim control. the ability to outflank the muslim states of north africa was seen as crucial to european survival. at the same time, the iberians learnt much from their arab neighbors. the northwestern region of eurasia has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its maritime history than any other continent. europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. in the maritime history of europe, the carrack and caravel both incorporated the lateen sail that made ships far more maneuverable. by translating the arab versions of lost ancient greek geographical works into latin, european navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of africa and asia.\\n\\n\\n==== mercantile capitalism ====\\n\\nmercantilism was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). this led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many european wars of the period and fueled european imperialism. belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of adam smith and the other classical economists won out.\\nthe commercial revolution was a period of economic expansion, colonialism, and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. beginning with the crusades, europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in europe. this development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the middle ages. european nations, through voyages of discovery, were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the european powers to build vast, new international trade networks. nations also sought new sources of wealth. to deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. the commercial revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.\\n\\n\\n===== trade and the new economy =====\\nin the old world, the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and spices. western europeans used the compass, new sailing ship technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable trade route to asia for valuable spices that mediterranean powers could not contest.\\n\\nin terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the carrack and caravel designs in portugal. these vessels evolved from medieval european designs from the north sea and both the christian and islamic mediterranean. they were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm mediterranean, baltic or north sea and sail safely on the open atlantic.\\nwhen the carrack and then the caravel were developed in iberia, european thoughts returned to the fabled east. these explorations have a number of causes. monetarists believe the main reason the age of exploration began was because of a severe shortage of bullion in europe. the european economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of europe into a recession. another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the iberians and the muslims to the south.\\n\\n\\n===== piracy\\'s golden age =====\\n\\nthe golden age of piracy is a designation given to one or more outbursts of piracy in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. the buccaneering period covers approximately the late 17th century. the period is characterized by anglo-french seamen based on jamaica and tortuga attacking spanish colonies and shipping in the caribbean and eastern pacific. a sailing route known as the pirate round was followed by certain anglo-american pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from bermuda and the americas to rob muslim and east india company targets in the indian ocean and red sea. the post-spanish succession period extending into the early 18th century, when anglo-american sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the war of the spanish succession turned en masse to piracy in the caribbean, the american eastern seaboard, the west african coast, and the indian ocean.\\n\\n\\n==== european states and politics ====\\nthe 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first european colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable european nation states that are the direct antecedents of today\\'s states.  although the renaissance included revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for european artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo, who inspired the term \"renaissance man\".during the baroque period the thirty years\\' war in central europe decimated the population by up to 20%. in 1648, the peace of westphalia, consisting of the treaties of osnabrück and münster, signed on may 15 and october 24, respectively, ended several wars in europe and established the beginning of sovereign states. the treaties involved the holy roman emperor, ferdinand iii (habsburg), the kingdoms of spain, france and sweden, the netherlands and their respective allies among the princes and the republican imperial states of the holy roman empire.\\nthe peace of westphalia resulted from the first modern diplomatic congress.  until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the holy roman empire.  the treaty of the pyrenees, signed in 1659, ended the war between france and spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.\\n\\n\\n===== absolutism =====\\nthe age of absolutism describes the monarchical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, legislatures, or social elites of the european monarchs during the transition from feudalism to capitalism. monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. nations that adopted absolutism include france, prussia, and russia. nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of state power, unification of the state laws, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of nobility.\\n\\n\\n===== french power =====\\nfor much of the reign of louis xiv, who was known as the sun king (french: le roi soleil), france stood as the leading power in europe, engaging in three major wars—the franco-dutch war, the war of the league of augsburg, and the war of the spanish succession—and two minor conflicts—the war of devolution, and the war of the reunions. louis ruled according to the divine right of kings, the theory that the king was crowned by god and accountable to him alone. consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal absolute monarch. louis xiv continued the work of his predecessor to create a centralized state, governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of feudalism that persisted in parts of france. he succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish palace of versailles.\\nmen who featured prominently in the political and military life of france during this period include mazarin, jean-baptiste colbert, turenne, vauban. french culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including molière, racine, boileau, la fontaine, lully, le brun, rigaud, louis le vau, jules hardouin mansart, claude perrault and le nôtre.\\n\\n\\n===== early english revolutions =====\\nbefore the age of revolution, the english civil war was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between parliamentarians and royalists. the first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of king charles i against the supporters of the long parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of king charles ii and supporters of the rump parliament. the civil war ended with the parliamentary victory at the battle of worcester. the monopoly of the church of england on christian worship in england ended with the victors consolidating the established protestant ascendancy in ireland. constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an english monarch cannot govern without parliament\\'s consent. the english restoration, or simply put as the restoration, began in 1660 when the english, scottish and irish monarchies were all restored under charles ii after the commonwealth of england that followed the english civil war. the glorious revolution of 1688 establishes modern parliamentary democracy in england.\\n\\n\\n===== international balance of power =====\\nthe war of the spanish succession was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several european powers combined to stop a possible unification of the kingdoms of spain and france under a single bourbon monarch, upsetting the european balance of power. it was fought mostly in europe, but it included queen anne\\'s war in north america.  the war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the duc de villars, the jacobite duke of berwick, the duke of marlborough and prince eugene of savoy.\\nthe peace of utrecht established after a series of individual peace treaties signed in the dutch city of utrecht concluded between various european states helped end the war of the spanish succession. the representatives who met were louis xiv of france and philip v of spain on the one hand, and representatives of queen anne of great britain, the duke of savoy, and the united provinces on the other. the treaty enregistered the defeat of french ambitions expressed in the wars of louis xiv and preserved the european system based on the balance of power. the treaty of utrecht marked the change from spanish to british naval supremacy.\\n\\n\\n== sub-saharan africa ==\\n\\nthe songhai empire took control of the trans-saharan trade at the beginning of the modern era. it seized timbuktu in 1468 and jenne in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of muslim merchants. the empire eventually made islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought muslim scholars to gao.around the beginning of the modern era, the benin kingdom was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of west africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. by the late 15th century benin was in contact with portugal. at its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, benin encompassed parts of southeastern yorubaland and the western igbo.\\n\\n\\n== new world and americas ==\\n\\nthe term colonialism is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, european or otherwise. european colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of christianity to sub-saharan africa, the americas, australia and the philippines.\\n\\n\\n=== exploration and conquest of the americas ===\\n\\nchristopher columbus came to the americas in 1492. subsequently, the major sea powers in europe sent expeditions to the new world to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to christianity. pope alexander vi divided newly discovered lands outside europe between spain and portugal along a north–south meridian 370 leagues west of the cape verde islands (off the west coast of africa). the division was never accepted by the rulers of england or france. (see also the treaty of tordesillas, which followed the papal decree.)\\n\\n\\n=== colonial latin america ===\\n\\nwhat is now called latin america, a designation first used in the late 19th century, was claimed by spain and portugal. the western hemisphere, the new world, was divided between the two iberian powers by the treaty of tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called \"ibero-america.\" spain called its overseas empire there \"the indies,\" with portugal calling its territory in south america brazil, after the dyewood found there. spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, \"indians,\" who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. both new spain (colonial mexico) and peru fit those criteria and the spanish crown established viceroyalties to rule those two large areas. as spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during administrative reforms rio de la plata (southeastern south america) and new granada (northern south america).\\ninitially, portuguese settlements (brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal africa, india and china. with sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in sugarcane.  black african slave labour from portugal\\'s west african possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. as the wealth of the ibero-america increased, some western european powers (dutch, french, british, danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the iberians had not settled in numbers. they seized some caribbean islands from the spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of north america in what are now the eastern seaboard of the united states and canada.\\n\\n\\n=== colonial north america ===\\n\\nnorth america outside the zone of spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. spain had founded small settlements in florida and georgia but nowhere near the size of those in new spain or the caribbean islands. france, the netherlands, and great britain held several colonies in north america and the west indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the spanish and portuguese established permanent colonies. the british colonies in north america were founded between 1607 (virginia) and 1733 (georgia). the dutch explored the east coast of north america and began founding settlements in what they called new netherland (now new york state.). france colonized what is now eastern canada, founding quebec city in 1608. france\\'s loss in the seven years\\' war resulted in the transfer of new france to great britain. the thirteen colonies, in lower british north america, rebelled against british rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that great britain was imposing on the colonies. the british colonies in canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the thirteen colonies proclaimed their independence on july 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 united states of america. with the 1783 treaty of paris ending the american revolutionary war, britain recognised the former thirteen colonies\\' independence.\\n\\n\\n== atlantic world ==\\n\\na recent development in early modern history is the creation of atlantic world as a category. the term generally encompasses western europe, west africa, north and south and america and the caribbean islands. it seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.\\n\\n\\n== religion, science, philosophy, and education ==\\n\\n\\n=== eastern philosophies ===\\nconcerning the development of eastern philosophies, much of eastern philosophy had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. the various philosophies include indian philosophy, chinese philosophy, iranian philosophy, japanese philosophy, and korean philosophy.\\n\\n\\n=== muslim world ===\\nthe islamic golden age reached its peak in the high middle ages, stopped short by the mongol invasions of the 13th century. the re-establishment of three major muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned ottoman safavid and mughal empires) gave rise to a muslim cultural revival. the safavids established twelver shi\\'a islam as iran\\'s official religion, thus giving iran a separate identity from its sunni neighbors.\\n\\n\\n=== protestant reformation ===\\n\\nthe early modern period was initiated by the protestant reformation and the collapse of the unity of the medieval western church.\\nthe theology of calvinism in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of capitalism (the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism).\\n\\n\\n=== counter-reformation and jesuits ===\\n\\nthe counter-reformation was a period of catholic revival in response to the protestant reformation during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. the counter-reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.\\nsuch reforms included the foundation of seminaries for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with christ, including the spanish mystics and the french school of spirituality. it also involved political activities that included the roman inquisition.\\nnew religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. orders such as the capuchins, ursulines, theatines, discalced carmelites, the barnabites, and especially the jesuits strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for catholic renewal.\\n\\n\\n=== scientific revolution ===\\n\\nthe great divergence in scientific discovery, technological innovation, and economic development began in the early modern period as the pace of change in western countries increased significantly compared to the rest of the world.\\nduring the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 century, empiricism and modern science replaced older methods of studying nature – european research methods that mainly involved reading texts by ancient writers. in ancient times, natural philosophers made observations of nature and came up with explanations, but never conducted experiments to test those explanations, because creating an artificial situation was considered an invalid way to discover the rules of nature. the scientific method of testing hypotheses was first recorded in the 10th century by ibn al-haytham (alhazen), inspiring roger bacon to begin experimenting in 13th century europe. by the time of the revolution, these methods resulted in accumulation of knowledge that overturned ideas inherited from ancient greece (primarily aristotelian physics, which includes the modern domains of physics, chemistry, biology) through the middle ages and islamic scholars. major changes of the scientific revolution and the 18th century included:\\n\\nthe ancient geocentric model of the solar system (the planets circle the earth) was replaced by the heliocentric model (earth and other planets circle the sun). known as the copernican revolution, the 1543 publication of nicolaus copernicus\\'s de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres, which was influenced by mu\\'ayyad al-din al-urdi and was based on detailed astronomical observations) is often used to mark the beginning of the scientific revolution. heliocentrism was resisted by the catholic church because it contradicted the bible; the catholic inquisition imprisoned galileo galilei (sometimes called the \"father of modern science\" for his many empirical discoveries) for promoting this theory.\\narmed with detailed observations from tycho brahe, johannes kepler found the idea that the planets moved in ellipses rather than on perfect celestial spheres, publishing kepler\\'s laws of planetary motion. the commonly held idea that the fixed stars are mounted on a large sphere was replaced by the idea that they are distant suns. astrology and astronomy began to separate into different disciplines, with only astronomy using scientific methods. telescope technology improved tremendously as did the study of optics.\\naristotle\\'s laws of motion were demonstrated to be incorrect, and were replaced by newton\\'s laws of motion and newton\\'s law of universal gravitation. the 1687 publication of isaac newton\\'s 1687 principia is often used to mark the end of the scientific revolution.\\na revival of atomism (denied by aristotle) and corpuscularianism began to undermine the classical elements. both 8th century islamic experimenter jabir ibn hayyan and 17th century christian experimenter robert boyle have been described as the founders of modern chemistry, both worked as alchemists before the fields were clearly separated. boyle argued for corpuscularism in the 1661 book the sceptical chymist, and discovered boyle\\'s law of gases. phlogiston theory was refuted by empirical discovery of conservation of mass, among other discoveries bring the chemical revolution. the discovery of modern chemical elements would not begin until the 19th century in the late modern period, followed by experimental confirmation of atoms.\\nfinally overcoming the difficulties human corpses to perform dissections, the anatomical descriptions of the 2nd century galen were updated by the 1543 publication of de humani corporis fabrica by andreas vesalius, considered a foundational text of modern medicine and early modern anatomy. the 1628 work de motu cordis\\' by william harvey was a major advance in the understanding of the circulatory system.\\nthe field of microbiology began with the invention of the microscope and the first observations of microorganisms, famously by anton van leeuwenhoek in the 1670s and probably also by athanasius kircher in the 1640s. though microorganisms were (correctly) proposed as the cause of infectious diseases as soon as they were discovered, this theory was generally dismissed. though scientific investigation undermined humorism in medicine, miasma theory remained dominant throughout the early modern period. the germ theory of disease was not widely accepted until the 1880s, in the late modern period.\\nmodern scientific dentistry was founded by pierre fauchard.\\nthe smallpox vaccine was invented in the 1770s and popularized by edward jenner in the 1790s, though it was unclear at the time how it worked.\\ncarl linnaeus published the first modern taxonomy in 1735, replacing aristotle\\'s great chain of being. binomial nomenclature was used in publications by gaspard bauhin as early as 1622, and by linnaeus in 1753.\\nthe ancient theory of spontaneous generation remained dominant throughout the early modern period, but the history of evolutionary thought includes some who questioned the strictest form of this dogma. the idea of partial common descent was famously promoted by georges-louis leclerc, comte de buffon. evolution was not fully articulated and accepted until the 19th century.\\nmodern geology began to take shape mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries. early on, nicolas steno proposed the law of superposition in 1669, and various writers in the history of geology began to question the notion derived from the christian bible that the earth was only about 6,000 years old and relatively unchanged over time. steno and james hutton are often considered founders of the modern field. the study of fossils and rock types became systematic.\\nearly developments in the history of electromagnetism during this era include gradual teasing out of the relationships between electricity, magnetism, and lightning; development of the electrostatic generator and leyden jar for storage; and the discoveries of ferromagnetism, \"electrics\" and \"non-electrics\" (conductors and insulators). the now-obsolete fluid theory of electricity was developed to explain electrical phenomena in terms of \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\" fluids (later recognized as positive and negative electrical charges). electrochemistry was born with the discovery of voltaic electricity (which would provide a power source for later experimentation) and pyroelectricity. around 1784, coulomb\\'s law mathematically described the strength of electrical attraction. the discovery that electricity could cause muscles to contracted was termed \"galvanic electricity\".in the new social sciences:\\n\\nhistorical linguistics emerged in the late 18th century as a field after the discovery of the common origin what are now called indo-european languages by philologist william jones\\nthe fields of anthropology and paleoanthropology emerged in the 18th century, but much of early modern anthropology is now considered scientific racism.\\nthe 1776 multi-book publication the wealth of nations by adam smith is considered the foundational text of classical economics.scientific discovery would accelerate in the late modern period, and continues today.\\n\\n\\n=== technology ===\\n\\ninventions of the early modern period included the floating dock, lifting tower, newspaper, grenade musket, lightning rod, bifocals, and franklin stove. early attempts at building a practical electrical telegraph were hindered because static electricity was the only source available.\\n\\n\\n=== enlightenment and reason ===\\n\\nthe age of enlightenment is also called the age of reason because it marked a change from the medieval tradition of scholasticism based on christian dogma and the often occultist approach of renaissance philosophy. instead, reason became the central source of knowledge, beginning the era of modern philosophy, especially in western philosophy. the period was typified in europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and ethics and often politics and the physical sciences as well.\\nearly 17th-century philosophy is often called the age of rationalism and is considered to succeed renaissance philosophy and precede the age of enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. this era includes isaac newton\\'s principia and rené descartes\\' \"i think therefore i am\" (1637). the 18th century saw the beginning of secularization in europe, rising to notability in the wake of the french revolution.\\nimmanuel kant classified his predecessors into two schools: the rationalists and the empiricists, the three main rationalists are normally taken to have been rené descartes, baruch spinoza, and gottfried leibniz.\\nroger williams founded providence plantations in new england, based on the principle of separation of church and state after being exiled by puritans in the massachusetts bay colony. the enlightenment began at harvard in 1646.\\nthe first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of gravity by isaac newton (1643–1727). newton, spinoza, john locke (1632–1704) and pierre bayle (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the ideas for the furthering of the enlightenment.\\nfrench salon culture culminated in the enlightenment\\'s most influential publication, the great encyclopédie (1751–1772), edited by denis diderot (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading philosophes (intellectuals) such as voltaire (1694–1778) and montesquieu (1689–1755). the quarrel of the ancients and the moderns shook up the french academy in the 1690s, elevating new discoveries over greek and roman wisdom. the french enlightenment was received in germany, notably fostered by frederick the great, the king of prussia, and gave rise to a flowering of german philosophy, represented foremost by immanuel kant.\\nthe french and german developments were further influential in scottish, russian, spanish and polish philosophy.\\nthe enlightenment flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to romanticism\\'s emphasis on emotion and a counter-enlightenment gained force.\\n\\n\\n=== humanism ===\\n\\nwith the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, italian renaissance humanism spread northward to france, germany, holland and england, where it became associated with the protestant reformation.\\ndeveloping during the enlightenment era, renaissance humanism as an intellectual movement spread across europe. the basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). the term umanista comes from the latter part of the 15th century. the people were associated with the studia humanitatis, a novel curriculum that was competing with the quadrivium and scholastic logic.in france, pre-eminent humanist guillaume budé (1467–1540) applied the philological methods of italian humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on justinian\\'s code. although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early italian umanisti), budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for francis i and helping to found the collège des lecteurs royaux (later the collège de france). meanwhile, marguerite de navarre, the sister of francis i, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic, gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including clément marot, pierre de ronsard and françois rabelais.\\n\\n\\n== end of early period ==\\n\\nthe end of the early modern period is usually associated with the industrial revolution, which began in britain around 1750, but began to make substantial changes in many european countries by around 1800.\\nthe age of revolutions starts at the end of the early modern period and continues into the late modern period, denoting in the decline of absolutism in europe. near the end of the early modern period were the second treaty of paris which ended the american revolution, the french revolution in 1789, and the napoleonic wars. the congress of vienna in 1815 marked the end of this period of political upheaval and frequent war, with the rise of new concepts of nationalism and reorganization of military forces. 1815 is the latest year commonly reckoned as the end of the early modern period.\\n\\n\\n==== the french revolutions ====\\n\\ntoward the middle and latter stages of the age of revolution, the french political and social revolutions and radical change saw the french governmental structure transform. it was previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and catholic clergy. it changed to forms based on enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. the first revolution led to government by the national assembly, the second by the legislative assembly, and the third by the directory.\\nthe changes were accompanied by violent turmoil, which included the trial and execution of louis xvi, vast bloodshed and repression during the reign of terror, and the french revolutionary wars involving every other major european power. subsequent events that can be traced to the revolution include the napoleonic wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern france took shape. in the following century, france would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\neconomic
