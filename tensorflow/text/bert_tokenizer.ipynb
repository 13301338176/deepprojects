              "['0 (zero) is a number, and the numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. it fulfills a central role in mathematics as the additive identity of the integers, real numbers, and many other algebraic structures. as a digit, 0 is used as a placeholder in place value systems. names for the number 0 in english include zero, nought (uk), naught (us) (), nil, or—in contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter \"o\"—oh or o (). informal or slang terms for zero include zilch and zip.ought and aught (), as well as cipher, have also been used historically.\\n\\n\\n== etymology ==\\n\\nthe word zero came into the english language via french zéro from italian zero, italian contraction of venetian zevero form of italian zefiro via ṣafira or ṣifr. in pre-islamic time the word ṣifr (arabic صفر) had the meaning \"empty\". sifr evolved to mean zero when it was used to translate śūnya (sanskrit: शून्य) from india. the first known english use of zero was in 1598.the italian mathematician fibonacci (c. 1170–1250), who grew up in north africa and is credited with introducing the decimal system to europe, used the term zephyrum. this became zefiro in italian, and was then contracted to zero in venetian. the italian word zefiro was already in existence (meaning \"west wind\" from latin and greek zephyrus) and may have influenced the spelling when transcribing arabic ṣifr.\\n\\n\\n=== modern usage ===\\nthere are different words used for the number or concept of zero depending on the context. for the simple notion of lacking, the words nothing and none are often used. sometimes the words nought, naught and aught are used. several sports have specific words for zero, such as nil in association football (soccer), love in tennis, and duck in cricket. it is often called oh in the context of telephone numbers. slang words for zero include zip, zilch, nada, and scratch. duck egg and goose egg are also slang for zero.\\n\\n\\n== history ==\\n\\n\\n=== ancient near east ===\\nancient egyptian numerals were base 10. they used hieroglyphs for the digits and were not positional. by 1770 bc, the egyptians had a symbol for zero in accounting texts. the symbol nfr, meaning beautiful, was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line.by the middle of the 2nd millennium bc, the babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated sexagesimal positional numeral system. the lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals. by 300 bc, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a placeholder in the same babylonian system. in a tablet unearthed at kish (dating from about 700 bc), the scribe bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.the babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. nor was it used at the end of a number. thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. only context could differentiate them.\\n\\n\\n=== pre-columbian americas ===\\n\\nthe mesoamerican long count calendar developed in south-central mexico and central america required the use of zero as a place-holder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. many different glyphs, including this partial quatrefoil——were used as a zero symbol for these long count dates, the earliest of which (on stela 2 at chiapa de corzo, chiapas) has a date of 36 bc.since the eight earliest long count dates appear outside the maya homeland, it is generally believed that the use of zero in the americas predated the maya and was possibly the invention of the olmecs. many of the earliest long count dates were found within the olmec heartland, although the olmec civilization ended by the 4th century bc, several centuries before the earliest known long count dates.\\nalthough zero became an integral part of maya numerals, with a different, empty tortoise-like \"shell shape\" used for many depictions of the \"zero\" numeral, it is assumed to have not influenced old world numeral systems.\\nquipu, a knotted cord device, used in the inca empire and its predecessor societies in the andean region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a base ten positional system. zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.\\n\\n\\n=== classical antiquity ===\\nthe ancient greeks had no symbol for zero (μηδέν), and did not use a digit placeholder for it. they seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. they asked themselves, \"how can nothing be something?\", leading to philosophical and, by the medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the vacuum. the paradoxes of zeno of elea depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero.\\n\\nby ad 130, ptolemy, influenced by hipparchus and the babylonians, was using a symbol for zero (a small circle with a long overbar) in his work on mathematical astronomy called the syntaxis mathematica, also known as the almagest. the way in which it is used can be seen in his table of chords in that book. ptolemy\\'s zero was used within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic greek numerals. because it was used alone, not just as a placeholder, this hellenistic zero was perhaps the earliest documented use of a numeral representing zero in the old world. however, the positions were usually limited to the fractional part of a number (called minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.)—they were not used for the integral part of a number, indicating a concept perhaps better expressed as \"none\", rather than \"zero\" in the modern sense. in later byzantine manuscripts of ptolemy\\'s almagest, the hellenistic zero had morphed into the greek letter omicron (otherwise meaning 70).\\nthe earliest use of zero in the calculation of the julian easter occurred before ad 311 at the first entry in a table of epacts as preserved in an ethiopic document for the years ad 311 to 369 using a ge\\'ez word for \"none\" (english translation is \"0\" elsewhere) alongside ge\\'ez numerals (based on greek numerals), which was translated from an equivalent table published by the church of alexandria in medieval greek. this use was repeated in ad 525 in an equivalent table that was translated via the latin nulla or \"none\" by dionysius exiguus, alongside roman numerals. when division produced zero as a remainder, nihil, meaning \"nothing\", was used. these medieval zeros were used by all future medieval calculators of easter. the initial \"n\" was used as a zero symbol in a table of roman numerals by bede or his colleagues around ad 725.\\n\\n\\n=== china ===\\n\\nthe sūnzĭ suànjīng, of unknown date but estimated to be dated from the 1st to 5th centuries ad, and japanese records dated from the 18th century, describe how the c. 4th century bc chinese counting rods system enables one to perform decimal calculations. according to a history of mathematics, the rods \"gave the decimal representation of a number, with an empty space denoting zero.\" the counting rod system is considered a positional notation system.in ad 690, empress wǔ promulgated zetian characters, one of which was \"〇\". the symbol 0 for denoting zero is a variation of this character.\\nzero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a \"vacant position\". qín jiǔsháo\\'s 1247 mathematical treatise in nine sections is the oldest surviving chinese mathematical text using a round symbol for zero. chinese authors had been familiar with the idea of negative numbers by the han dynasty (2nd century ad), as seen in the nine chapters on the mathematical art.\\n\\n\\n=== india ===\\npingala (c. 3rd/2nd century bc), a sanskrit prosody scholar, used binary numbers in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), a notation similar to morse code. pingala used the sanskrit word śūnya explicitly to refer to zero.it was considered that the earliest text to use a decimal place-value system, including a zero, is the lokavibhāga, a jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval sanskrit translation of the prakrit original, which is internally dated to ad 458 (saka era 380). in this text, śūnya (\"void, empty\") is also used to refer to zero.a symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow symbol, is used throughout the bakhshali manuscript, a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants. in 2017 three samples from the manuscript were shown by radiocarbon dating to come from three different centuries: from ad 224–383, ad 680–779, and ad 885–993, making it the world\\'s oldest recorded use of the zero symbol. it is not known how the birch bark fragments from different centuries that form the manuscript came to be packaged together.the origin of the modern decimal-based place value notation can be traced to the aryabhatiya (c. 500), which states sthānāt sthānaṁ daśaguṇaṁ syāt \"from place to place each is ten times the preceding.\" the concept of zero as a digit in the decimal place value notation was developed in india, presumably as early as during the gupta period (c. 5th century), with the oldest unambiguous evidence dating to the 7th century.the rules governing the use of zero appeared for the first time in brahmagupta\\'s brahmasputha siddhanta (7th century). this work considers not only zero, but also negative numbers and the algebraic rules for the elementary operations of arithmetic with such numbers. in some instances, his rules differ from the modern standard, specifically the definition of the value of zero divided by zero as zero.\\n\\n\\n==== epigraphy ====\\n\\nthere are numerous copper plate inscriptions, with the same small o in them, some of them possibly dated to the 6th century, but their date or authenticity may be open to doubt.a stone tablet found in the ruins of a temple near sambor on the mekong, kratié province, cambodia, includes the inscription of \"605\" in khmer numerals (a set of numeral glyphs for the hindu–arabic numeral system). the number is the year of the inscription in the saka era, corresponding to a date of ad 683.the first known use of special glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found at the chaturbhuj temple, gwalior, in india, dated 876. zero is also used as a placeholder in the bakhshali manuscript, portions of which date from ad 224–383.\\n\\n\\n=== middle ages ===\\n\\n\\n==== transmission to islamic culture ====\\n\\nthe arabic-language inheritance of science was largely greek, followed by hindu influences. in 773, at al-mansur\\'s behest, translations were made of many ancient treatises including greek, roman, indian, and others.\\nin ad 813, astronomical tables were prepared by a persian mathematician, muḥammad ibn mūsā al-khwārizmī, using hindu numerals; and about 825, he published a book synthesizing greek and hindu knowledge and also contained his own contribution to mathematics including an explanation of the use of zero. this book was later translated into latin in the 12th century under the title algoritmi de numero indorum. this title means \"al-khwarizmi on the numerals of the indians\". the word \"algoritmi\" was the translator\\'s latinization of al-khwarizmi\\'s name, and the word \"algorithm\" or \"algorism\" started meaning any arithmetic based on decimals.muhammad ibn ahmad al-khwarizmi, in 976, stated that if no number appears in the place of tens in a calculation, a little circle should be used \"to keep the rows\". this circle was called ṣifr.\\n\\n\\n==== transmission to europe ====\\nthe hindu–arabic numeral system (base 10) reached europe in the 11th century, via al-andalus through spanish muslims, the moors, together with knowledge of astronomy and instruments like the astrolabe, first imported by gerbert of aurillac. for this reason, the numerals came to be known in europe as \"arabic numerals\". the italian mathematician fibonacci or leonardo of pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into european mathematics in 1202, stating:\\n\\nafter my father\\'s appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of bugia for the pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. there, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it i realized that all its aspects were studied in egypt, syria, greece, sicily, and provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. i pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. but all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of pythagoras, i considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the hindus (modus indorum). therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of euclid\\'s geometric art. i have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as i could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. almost everything which i have introduced i have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. if i have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, i beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. the nine indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. with these nine figures, and with the sign 0  ... any number may be written.\\nhere leonardo of pisa uses the phrase \"sign 0\", indicating it is like a sign to do operations like addition or multiplication. from the 13th century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in europe where they were called algorismus after the persian mathematician al-khwārizmī. the most popular was written by johannes de sacrobosco, about 1235 and was one of the earliest scientific books to be printed in 1488. until the late 15th century, hindu–arabic numerals seem to have predominated among mathematicians, while merchants preferred to use the roman numerals. in the 16th century, they became commonly used in europe.\\n\\n\\n== mathematics ==\\n0 is the integer immediately preceding 1. zero is an even number because it is divisible by 2 with no remainder. 0 is neither positive nor negative. many definitions include 0 as a natural number, and then the only natural number not to be positive. zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of null size. in most cultures, 0 was identified before the idea of negative things, or quantities less than zero, was accepted.\\nthe value, or number, zero is not the same as the digit zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. a zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. in some instances, a leading zero may be used to distinguish a number.\\n\\n\\n=== elementary algebra ===\\nthe number 0 is the smallest non-negative integer. the natural number following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. the number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is an integer, and hence a rational number and a real number (as well as an algebraic number and a complex number).\\nthe number 0 is neither positive nor negative and is usually displayed as the central number in a number line. it is neither a prime number nor a composite number. it cannot be prime because it has an infinite number of factors, and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed as a product of prime numbers (0 must always be one of the factors). zero is, however, even (i.e. a multiple of 2, as well as being a multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number).\\nthe following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. these rules apply for any real or complex number x, unless otherwise stated.\\n\\naddition: x + 0 = 0 + x = x. that is, 0 is an identity element (or neutral element) with respect to addition.\\nsubtraction: x − 0 = x and 0 − x = −x.\\nmultiplication: x · 0 = 0 · x = 0.\\ndivision: 0/x = 0, for nonzero x. but x/0 is undefined, because 0 has no multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule.\\nexponentiation: x0 = x/x = 1, except that the case x = 0 may be left undefined in some contexts. for all positive real x, 0x = 0.the expression 0/0, which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form f(x)/g(x) as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called \"indeterminate form\". that does not simply mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of f(x)/g(x), if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l\\'hôpital\\'s rule.\\nthe sum of 0 numbers (the empty sum) is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the empty product) is 1. the factorial 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.\\n\\n\\n=== other branches of mathematics ===\\nin set theory, 0 is the cardinality of the empty set: if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. in fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is defined to be the empty set. when this is done, the empty set is the von neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. the cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.\\nalso in set theory, 0 is the lowest ordinal number, corresponding to the empty set viewed as a well-ordered set.\\nin propositional logic, 0 may be used to denote the truth value false.\\nin abstract algebra, 0 is commonly used to denote a zero element, which is a neutral element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an absorbing element for multiplication (if defined).\\nin lattice theory, 0 may denote the bottom element of a bounded lattice.\\nin category theory, 0 is sometimes used to denote an initial object of a category.\\nin recursion theory, 0 can be used to denote the turing degree of the partial computable functions.\\n\\n\\n=== related mathematical terms ===\\na zero of a function f is a point x in the domain of the function such that f(x) = 0. when there are finitely many zeros these are called the roots of the function. this is related to zeros of a holomorphic function.\\nthe zero function (or zero map) on a domain d is the constant function with 0 as its only possible output value, i.e., the function f defined by f(x) = 0 for all x in d. the zero function is the only function that is both even and odd. a particular zero function is a zero morphism in category theory; e.g., a zero map is the identity in the additive group of functions. the determinant on non-invertible square matrices is a zero map.\\nseveral branches of mathematics have zero elements, which generalize either the property 0 + x = x, or the property 0 · x = 0, or both.\\n\\n\\n== physics ==\\nthe value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. for some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. for example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins) zero is the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). this is in contrast to for example temperatures on the celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. in physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.\\n\\n\\n== chemistry ==\\nzero has been proposed as the atomic number of the theoretical element tetraneutron. it has been shown that a cluster of four neutrons may be stable enough to be considered an atom in its own right. this would create an element with no protons and no charge on its nucleus.\\nas early as 1926, andreas von antropoff coined the term neutronium for a conjectured form of matter made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the periodic table. it was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements.\\n\\n\\n== computer science ==\\nthe most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic computer programming languages such as fortran and cobol. however, in the late 1950s lisp introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. for example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in c, so that for an array of n items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to n−1. this permits an array element\\'s location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of the array, whereas 1-based languages precalculate the array\\'s base address to be the position one element before the first.there can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing, for example java\\'s jdbc indexes parameters from 1 although java itself uses 0-based indexing.in databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. it is then said to have a null value. for numeric fields it is not the value zero. for text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. the presence of null values leads to three-valued logic. no longer is a condition either true or false, but it can be undetermined. any computation including a null value delivers a null result.a null pointer is a pointer in a computer program that does not point to any object or function. in c, the integer constant 0 is converted into the null pointer at compile time when it appears in a pointer context, and so 0 is a standard way to refer to the null pointer in code. however, the internal representation of the null pointer may be any bit pattern (possibly different values for different data types).in mathematics −0 = +0 = 0; both −0 and +0 represent exactly the same number, i.e., there is no \"positive zero\" or \"negative zero\" distinct from zero. however, in some computer hardware signed number representations, zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives; this kind of dual representation is known as signed zero, with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. these representations include the signed magnitude and one\\'s complement binary integer representations (but not the two\\'s complement binary form used in most modern computers), and most floating point number representations (such as ieee 754 and ibm s/390 floating point formats).\\nin binary, 0 represents the value for \"off\", which means no electricity flow.zero is the value of false in many programming languages.\\nthe unix epoch (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of january 1970.the macos epoch and palm os epoch (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of january 1904.many apis and operating systems that require applications to return an integer value as an exit status typically use zero to indicate success and non-zero values to indicate specific error or warning conditions.\\n\\n\\n== other fields ==\\nin telephony, pressing 0 is often used for dialling out of a company network or to a different city or region, and 00 is used for dialling abroad. in some countries, dialling 0 places a call for operator assistance.\\ndvds that can be played in any region are sometimes referred to as being \"region 0\"\\nroulette wheels usually feature a \"0\" space (and sometimes also a \"00\" space), whose presence is ignored when calculating payoffs (thereby allowing the house to win in the long run).\\nin formula one, if the reigning world champion no longer competes in formula one in the year following their victory in the title race, 0 is given to one of the drivers of the team that the reigning champion won the title with. this happened in 1993 and 1994, with damon hill driving car 0, due to the reigning world champion (nigel mansell and alain prost respectively) not competing in the championship.\\non the u.s. interstate highway system, in most states exits are numbered based on the nearest milepost from the highway\\'s western or southern terminus within that state. several that are less than half a mile (800 m) from state boundaries in that direction are numbered as exit 0.\\n\\n\\n== symbols and representations ==\\n\\nthe modern numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter o more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between o and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. the distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.a slashed zero can be used to distinguish the number from the letter. the digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on ibm 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as andalé mono, and in some airline reservation systems. one variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-o–digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular (closer to a rectangle). a further distinction is made in falsification-hindering typeface as used on german car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. sometimes the digit 0 is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether.\\n\\n\\n== year label ==\\n\\nin the bc calendar era, the year 1 bc is the first year

              " 'abiogenesis, or informally the origin of life, is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. while the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes. although the occurrence of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists, its possible mechanisms are poorly understood. there are several principles and hypotheses for how abiogenesis could have occurred.\\nresearchers study abiogenesis through a combination of molecular biology, paleontology, astrobiology, oceanography, biophysics, geochemistry and biochemistry, and aim to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life. the study of abiogenesis can be geophysical, chemical, or biological, with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three, as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on earth today. life functions through the specialized chemistry of carbon and water and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: lipids (fatty cell walls), carbohydrates (sugars, cellulose), amino acids (protein metabolism), and nucleic acids (self-replicating dna and rna). any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules. many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how self-replicating molecules, or their components, came into existence. researchers generally think that current life descends from an rna world, although other self-replicating molecules may have preceded rna.the classic 1952 miller–urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early earth. scientists have proposed various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions, including lightning and radiation. other approaches (\"metabolism-first\" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems on the early earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-replication.the alternative panspermia hypothesis speculates that microscopic life arose outside earth by unknown mechanisms, and spread to the early earth on space dust and meteoroids. it is known that complex organic molecules occur in the solar system and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on earth. an extreme speculation is that the biochemistry of life could have begun as early as 17 million years after the big bang, during a habitable epoch, and that life may exist throughout the universe.earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbour life, and fossil evidence from the earth informs most studies of abiogenesis. the age of the earth is approximately 4.54 billion years; the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago, and possibly as early as the eoarchean era (between 3.6 and 4.0 billion years ago), after geological crust started to solidify following the molten hadean eon. in may 2017 scientists found possible evidence of early life on land in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the pilbara craton of western australia. however, a number of discoveries suggest that life may have appeared on earth even earlier. as of 2017, microfossils, or fossilised microorganisms, within hydrothermal-vent precipitates dated from 3.77 to 4.28 billion years old found in rocks in quebec may harbour the oldest record of life on earth, suggesting life started soon after ocean formation 4.4 billion years ago. according to biologist stephen blair hedges, \"if life arose relatively quickly on earth … then it could be common in the universe.\" however, extraterrestrial technically intelligent life, in contrast to the simpler microbial life referred to by hedges, may be so rare that humankind\\'s nearest neighbors may be beyond the possibility of our ever contacting them. astronomer jill tarter, of the seti institute, said that the factors of the drake equation (which estimates the possibility of communicating with other [technically intelligent] life) are a means of organizing our lack of knowledge.\\n\\n\\n== early conditions of the universe and earth ==\\n\\nsoon after the big bang, which occurred roughly 14 billion years ago, the only chemical elements present in the universe were hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest atoms in the periodic table. these elements gradually came together to form stars. these early stars were massive and short-lived, producing heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. as these stars reached the end of their lifecycles, they ejected these heavier elements, among them carbon and oxygen, throughout the universe. these heavier elements allowed for the formation of new objects, including rocky planets and other bodies. according to the nebular hypothesis, the formation and evolution of the solar system began 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small solar system bodies formed. the earth, 4.5 billion years ago, was at first inhospitable to any living organisms. based on numerous observations and studies of the  geological time-scale, the hadean earth is thought to have had a secondary atmosphere, formed through degassing of the rocks that accumulated from planetesimal impactors. at first, it was thought that the earth\\'s atmosphere consisted of hydrogen compounds—methane, ammonia and water vapour—and that life began under such reducing conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. according to later models, suggested by studying ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late hadean period consisted largely of water vapour, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and sulfur compounds. during its formation, the earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining. as a consequence, earth lacked the gravity to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. the solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly acidic, giving them a ph of about 5.5. the atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a \"gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory.\" it may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.oceans may have appeared first in the hadean eon, as soon as two hundred million years (200 ma) after the earth formed, in a hot 100 °c (212 °f) reducing environment, and the ph of about 5.8 rose rapidly towards neutral. this scenario has found support from the dating of 4.404 ga-old zircon crystals from metamorphosed quartzite of mount narryer in the western australia jack hills of the pilbara, which provide evidence that oceans and continental crust existed within 150 ma of earth\\'s formation. despite the likely increased volcanism and existence of many smaller tectonic \"platelets,\" it has been suggested that between 4.4 and 4.3 ga (billion years), the earth was a water world, with little if any continental crust, an extremely turbulent atmosphere and a hydrosphere subject to intense ultraviolet (uv) light, from a t tauri stage sun, cosmic radiation and continued bolide impacts.the hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. frequent collisions with large objects, up to 500 kilometres (310 mi) in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the oceans within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. after a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. after that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. for another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.\\n\\n\\n=== earliest biological evidence for life ===\\n\\nthe most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain bacteria and a clade formed by archaea and eukaryota of what is referred to as the \"traditional tree of life\" based on several molecular studies starting with  c. woese. a very small minority of studies have concluded differently, namely that the root is in the domain bacteria, either in the phylum firmicutes or that the phylum chloroflexi is basal to a clade with archaea+eukaryotes and the rest of bacteria as proposed by thomas cavalier-smith. more recently,  peter ward has proposed an alternative view which is rooted in abiotic rna synthesis which becomes enclosed within a capsule and then creates rna ribozyme replicates. it is proposed that this then bifurcates between dominion ribosa (rna life), and after the loss of ribozymes rna viruses as domain viorea, and dominion terroa, which after creating a large cell within a lipid wall, creating dna the 20 based amino acids and the triplet code, is established as the last universal common ancestor or luca, of earlier phylogenic trees.\\n\\nthe earliest life on earth existed more than 3.5 billion years ago, during the eoarchean era when sufficient crust had solidified following the molten hadean eon. the earliest physical evidence so far found consists of microfossils in the nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt of northern quebec, in \"banded iron formation\" rocks at least 3.77 billion and possibly 4.28 billion years old. this finding suggested life developed very soon after oceans  formed. the structure of the microbes was noted to be similar to bacteria found near hydrothermal vents in the modern era, and provided support for the hypothesis that abiogenesis began near hydrothermal vents.also noteworthy is biogenic graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from southwestern greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from western australia. evidence of early life in rocks from akilia island, near the isua supracrustal belt in southwestern greenland, dating to 3.7 billion years ago have shown biogenic carbon isotopes. in other parts of the isua supracrustal belt, graphite inclusions trapped within garnet crystals are connected to the other elements of life: oxygen, nitrogen, and possibly phosphorus in the form of phosphate, providing further evidence for life 3.7 billion years ago.  at strelley pool, in the pilbara region of western australia, compelling evidence of early life was found in pyrite-bearing sandstone in a fossilized beach, that showed rounded tubular cells that oxidized sulfur by photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen. further research on zircons from western australia in 2015 suggested that life likely existed on earth at least 4.1 billion years ago.traditionally it was thought that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8 ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the moon and the other inner planets (mercury, mars, and presumably earth and venus). this would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. geologically, the hadean earth would have been far more active than at any other time in its history. studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 (717 thousand) years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 (1.25 billion) years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.\\nthe time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. if the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2 ga. if the site was at the surface of the earth, abiogenesis could only have occurred between 3.7 and 4.0 ga.in 2016, a set of 355 genes likely present in the last universal common ancestor (luca) of all organisms living on earth was identified. a total of 6.1 million prokaryotic protein coding genes from various phylogenic trees were sequenced, identifying 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to luca. the results \"depict luca as anaerobic, co2-fixing, h2-dependent with a wood–ljungdahl pathway, n2-fixing and thermophilic. luca’s biochemistry was replete with fes clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, s-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme a, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations.\" the results depict methanogenic clostridia as a basal clade in the 355 phylogenies examined, and suggest that luca inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in h2, co2 and iron. m.d. brazier has shown that early micro-fossils came from a hot world of gases such as methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, which are toxic to much current life. another analysis of the conventional threefold tree of life shows thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea are closest to the root, suggesting that life may have evolved in a hot environment.\\n\\n\\n== conceptual history ==\\n\\n\\n=== spontaneous generation ===\\n\\ntraditional religion attributed the origin of life to supernatural deities who created the natural world. spontaneous generation, the first naturalistic theory of life arising from non-life, goes back to aristotle and ancient greek philosophy, and continued to have support in western scholarship until the 19th century. classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain \"lower\" or \"vermin\" animals are generated by decaying organic substances. according to aristotle, it was readily observable that aphids arise from dew on plants, flies from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting sunken logs, and so on. a related theory was heterogenesis: that some forms of life could arise from different forms (e.g. bees from flowers). the modern scientist john desmond bernal said that the basic idea of such theories was that life was continuously created as a result of chance events.in the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. in 1646, sir thomas browne published his pseudodoxia epidemica (subtitled enquiries into very many received tenets, and commonly presumed truths), which was an attack on false beliefs and \"vulgar errors.\" his contemporary, alexander ross, erroneously refuted him, stating: \"to question this [spontaneous generation], is to question reason, sense, and experience: if he doubts of this, let him go to ægypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants.\"in 1665, robert hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism. hooke was followed in 1676 by antonie van leeuwenhoek, who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been protozoa and bacteria. many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for sexual reproduction, and asexual reproduction through cell division had not yet been observed. van leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from putrefaction, and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.\\n\\nthe first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when francesco redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. it was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. the alternative hypothesis was biogenesis: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (omne vivum ex ovo, latin for \"every living thing from an egg\"). in 1768, lazzaro spallanzani demonstrated that microbes were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. in 1861, louis pasteur performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without.\\nby the middle of the 19th century, biogenesis had accumulated so much evidence in support that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. louis pasteur remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, \"never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment.\" gave a mechanism by which life diversified from a few simple organisms to a variety of to complex forms. today, scientists agree that all current life descends from earlier life, which has become progressively more complex and diverse through charles darwin\\'s mechanism of evolution by natural selection.\\nhowever, the findings of cosmology on the origin of the universe in the big bang, and of geology on the origin of the earth from interstellar gas, require a companion explanation for the origin of the first life from non-life. one of the first speculations on this subject was in darwin\\'s letter to joseph dalton hooker on 1 february 1871, suggesting that the original spark of life may have begun in a \"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &c., present, that a proteine compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes.\" he went on to explain that \"at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.\" he had written to hooker in 1863 stating that, \"it is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter.\" in on the origin of species, he had referred to life having been \"created\", by which he \"really meant \\'appeared\\' by some wholly unknown process\", but had soon regretted using the old testament term \"creation\".\\n\\n\\n=== etymology ===\\n\\nthe term biogenesis is usually credited to either henry charlton bastian or to thomas henry huxley. bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with john tyndall to mean \"life-origination or commencement\". in 1870, huxley, as new president of the british association for the advancement of science, delivered an address entitled biogenesis and abiogenesis. in it he introduced the term biogenesis (with an opposite meaning to bastian\\'s) as well as abiogenesis:\\n\\nand thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. it will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, i shall call it the hypothesis of biogenesis; and i shall term the contrary doctrine—that living matter may be produced by not living matter—the hypothesis of abiogenesis.subsequently, in the preface to bastian\\'s 1871 book, the modes of origin of lowest organisms, bastian referred to the possible confusion with huxley\\'s usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning:\\n\\na word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term archebiosis. i had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word biogenesis to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. but in the mean time the word biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. he also introduced the word abiogenesis. i have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. wishing to avoid all needless confusion, i therefore renounced the use of the word biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, i was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.since the end of the nineteenth century, \\'evolutive abiogenesis\\' means increasing complexity and evolution of matter from inert to living states.\\n\\n\\n=== \"primordial soup\" hypothesis ===\\n\\nno new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when alexander oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for life. in his book the origin of life, he proposed (echoing darwin) that the \"spontaneous generation of life\" that had been attacked by louis pasteur did in fact occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. oparin argued that a \"primeval soup\" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of sunlight. these would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed coacervate droplets. these droplets would \"grow\" by fusion with other droplets, and \"reproduce\" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which factors that promote \"cell integrity\" survive, and those that do not become extinct. many modern theories of the origin of life still take oparin\\'s ideas as a starting point.\\nrobert shapiro has summarized the \"primordial soup\" theory of oparin and j. b. s. haldane in its \"mature form\" as follows:\\nthe early earth had a chemically reducing atmosphere.\\nthis atmosphere, exposed to energy in various forms, produced simple organic compounds (\"monomers\").\\nthese compounds accumulated in a \"soup\" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, oceanic vents etc.).\\nby further transformation, more complex organic polymers—and ultimately life—developed in the soup.about this time, haldane suggested that the earth\\'s prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a \"hot dilute soup\" in which organic compounds could have formed. bernal called this idea biopoiesis or biopoesis, the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but non-living molecules, and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.\\none of the most important pieces of experimental support for the \"soup\" theory came in 1952. stanley l. miller and harold c. urey performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the oparin-haldane hypothesis. the now-famous miller–urey experiment used a highly reducing mixture of gases—methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, as well as water vapour—to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids. the mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. after one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a racemic mixture of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. this provided direct experimental support for the second point of the \"soup\" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centres.\\nbernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. the underlying hypothesis held by oparin, haldane, bernal, miller and urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors. a 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the miller and urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. one of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found. however, bernal said that \"it is not enough to explain the formation of such molecules, what is necessary, is a physical-chemical explanation of the origins of these molecules that suggests the presence of suitable sources and sinks for free energy.\"more recent studies, in october 2017, support the notion that life may have begun right after the earth was formed as rna molecules emerging from \"warm little ponds\".\\n\\n\\n=== proteinoid microspheres ===\\n\\nin trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by bernal, sidney w. fox in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in earth\\'s history. in one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. he found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic polypeptide molecules now named \"proteinoid microspheres\".in another experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, fox collected volcanic material from a cinder cone in hawaii. he discovered that the temperature was over 100 °c (212 °f) just 4 inches (100 mm) beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. he placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. a brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. the amino acids had combined to form proteinoids, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that fox called \"microspheres\". his proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of cyanobacteria, but they contained no functional nucleic acids or any encoded information. based upon such experiments, colin s. pittendrigh stated in december 1967 that \"laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years,\" a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.\\n\\n\\n== current models ==\\nthere is no single, generally accepted model for the origin of life. scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses, which share some common elements. while differing in the details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by alexander oparin (in 1924) and by j. b. s. haldane (in 1925), that the first molecules constituting the earliest cells \"were synthesized under natural conditions by a slow process of molecular evolution, and these molecules then organized into the first molecular system with properties with biological order\". oparin and haldane suggested that the atmosphere of the early earth may have been chemically reducing in nature, composed primarily of methane (ch4), ammonia (nh3), water (h2o), hydrogen sulfide (h2s), carbon dioxide (co2) or carbon monoxide (co), and phosphate (po43−), with molecular oxygen (o2) and ozone (o3) either rare or absent. according to later models, the atmosphere in the late hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (n2) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (h2), and sulfur compounds; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone, it was not as chemically reducing as oparin and haldane supposed.\\nbernal coined the term biopoiesis in 1949 to refer to the origin of life. in 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three \"stages\":\\n\\nthe origin of biological monomers\\nthe origin of biological polymers\\nthe evolution from molecules to cellsbernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. bernal regarded the third stage—discovering methods by which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell\\'s boundary—as the most difficult. modern work on the way that cell membranes self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates, may be a key step towards understanding the development of independent free-living cells.the chemical processes on the pre-biotic early earth are called chemical evolution. both manfred eigen and sol spiegelman demonstrated that evolution, including replication, variation, and natural selection, can occur in populations of molecules as well as in organisms. following on from chemical evolution came the initiation of biological evolution, which led to the first cells. no one has yet synthesized a \"protocell\" using simple components with the necessary properties of life (the so-called \"bottom-up-approach\"). without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to focus on chemosynthesis. however, some researchers work in this field, notably steen rasmussen and jack w. szostak. others have argued that a \"top-down approach\" is more feasible. spiegelman took advantage of natural selection to synthesize the spiegelman monster, which had a genome with just 218 nucleotide bases, having deconstructively evolved from a 4500-base bacterial rna. eigen built on spiegelman\\'s work and produced a similar system further degraded to just 48 or 54 nucleotides—the minimum required for the binding of the replication enzyme. craig venter and others at j. craig venter institute engineered existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes, attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life are reached.the nasa strategy on abiogenesis states that it is necessary to identify interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable macromolecular systems. emphasis must continue to map the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. the advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection likely was a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution.in october 2018, researchers at mcmaster university announced the development of a new technology, called a planet simulator, to help study the origin of life on planet earth and beyond. it consists of a sophisticated climate chamber to study how the building blocks of life were assembled and how these prebiotic molecules transitioned into self-replicating rna molecules.\\n\\n\\n== chemical origin of organic molecules ==\\nthe elements, except for hydrogen and helium, ultimately derive from stellar nucleosynthesis. in 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of life—the carbon-hydrogen molecule (ch, or methylidyne radical), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (ch+) and the carbon ion (c+)—are largely the result of ultraviolet light from stars, rather than other forms of radiation from supernovae and young stars, as thought earlier. complex molecules, including organic molecules, form naturally both in space and on planets. there are two possible sources of organic molecules on the early earth:\\n\\nterrestrial origins – organic molecule synthesis driven by impact shocks or by other energy sources (such as uv light, redox coupling, or electrical discharges; e.g., miller\\'s experiments)\\nextraterrestrial origins – formation of organic molecules in interstellar dust clouds, which rain down on planets. (see pseudo-panspermia)\\nbased on recent computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the sun before the formation of the earth. according to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. (also see extraterrestrial organic molecules).\\nestimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the late heavy bombardment before 3.5 ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources.it has been estimated that the late heavy bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the earth\\'s surface to a depth of tens of metres. if life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the t tauri stage of the sun\\'s evolution. simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the miller-urey experiments. in the deep hydrothermal vents, everett shock has found \"there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as seawater and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state.\" shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100–150 degrees celsius, precisely the temperatures at which the hyperthermophilic bacteria and thermoacidophilic archaea have been found, at the base of the phylogenetic tree of life closest to the last universal common ancestor (luca).the accumulation and concentration of organic molecules on a planetary surface is also considered an essential early step for the origin of life. identifying and understanding the mechanisms that led to the production of prebiotic\\nmolecules in various environments is critical for establishing the inventory of ingredients from which life originated on earth, assuming that the abiotic production of molecules ultimately influenced the selection of molecules from which life emerged.in november 2019, scientists reported detecting, for the first time, sugar molecules, including ribose, in meteorites, suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bio-ingredients important to life, and supporting the notion of an rna world prior to a dna-based origin of life on earth, and possibly, as well, the notion of panspermia.\\n\\n\\n=== chemical synthesis ===\\nwhile features of self-organization and self-replication are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. stan palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of ribonucleic acid (rna) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents. virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early earth. for example, heat (such as from geothermal processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others. computer simulations also suggest that cavitation in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds. unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. for example, this was probably important for carbon fixation (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one). carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral ph and 100 °c (212 °f). iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites.as early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts.  in particular, experiments by butlerov (the formose reaction) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium.  the reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by breslow in 1959.  similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.\\nformamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. formamide is ubiquitous in the universe, produced by the reaction of water and hydrogen cyanide (hcn). it has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water. although hcn is poisonous, it only affects aerobic organisms (eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist. it can play roles in other chemical processes as well, such as the synthesis of the amino acid glycine.in 1961, it was shown that the nucleic acid purine base adenine can be formed by heating aqueous ammonium cyanide solutions. other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials were also reported. leslie e. orgel and colleagues have shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis of purines, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide. research by stanley l. miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. research by the miller group notes the formation of seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972 to 1997. other work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source). the explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. as an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. these impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often. mechanistic exploration using quantum chemical methods provide a more detailed understanding of some of the chemical processes involved in chemical evolution, and a partial answer to the fundamental question of molecular biogenesis.at the time of the miller–urey experiment, scientific consensus was that the early earth had a reducing atmosphere with compounds relatively rich in hydrogen and poor in oxygen (e.g., ch4 and nh3 as opposed to co2 and nitrogen dioxide (no2)). however, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as either weakly reducing or neutral (see also oxygen catastrophe). such an atmosphere would diminish both the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced, although studies that include iron and carbonate minerals (thought present in early oceans) in the experimental conditions have again produced a diverse array of amino acids. other scientific research has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea thermal vents.the spontaneous formation of complex polymers from abiotically generated monomers under the conditions posited by the \"soup\" theory is not at all a straightforward process. besides the necessary basic organic monomers, compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were also formed in high concentration during the miller–urey and joan oró experiments. the miller–urey experiment, for example, produces many substances that would react with the amino acids or terminate their coupling into peptide chains.a research project completed in march 2015 by john d. sutherland and others found that a network of reactions beginning with hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide, in streams of water irradiated by uv light, could produce the chemical components of proteins and lipids, as well as those of rna, while not producing a wide range of other compounds. the researchers used the term \"cyanosulfidic\" to describe this network of reactions.\\n\\n\\n=== autocatalysis ===\\n\\nautocatalysts are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are \"molecular replicators.\" the simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. the product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. the product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. such systems have been demonstrated both in biological macromolecules and in small organic molecules. systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of micelles and vesicles, have also been observed.it has been proposed that life initially arose as autocatalytic chemical networks. british ethologist richard dawkins wrote about autocatalysis as a potential explanation for the origin of life in his 2004 book the ancestor\\'s tale. in his book, dawkins cites experiments performed by julius rebek jr. and his colleagues in which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester (aate). one product was a variant of aate, which catalyzed the synthesis of themselves. this experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which could be interpreted as a rudimentary form of natural selection.in the early 1970s, manfred eigen and peter schuster examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating hypercycle in a prebiotic soup. in a hypercycle, the information storing system (possibly rna) produces an enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. mathematically treated, hypercycles could create quasispecies, which through natural selection entered into a form of darwinian evolution. a boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. the hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the miller–urey experiment.\\ngeoffrey w. hoffmann has shown that an early error-prone translation machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical for the origin of life, and was known as \"orgel\\'s paradox\".hoffmann has furthermore argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of earth hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. this aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.\\n\\n\\n=== homochirality ===\\n\\nhomochirality refers to a geometric uniformity of some materials composed of chiral units. chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3d forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality (\"handedness\"): with almost no exceptions, amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and sugars are right-handed. chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral catalyst, they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both enantiomers (called a racemic mixture). known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the earth\\'s rotation, statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis, and spontaneous symmetry breaking.once established, chirality would be selected for. a small bias (enantiomeric excess) in the population can be amplified into a large one by asymmetric autocatalysis, such as in the soai reaction. in asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalyzing its own production. an initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.clark has suggested that homochirality may have started in outer space, as the studies of the amino acids on the murchison meteorite showed that l-alanine is more than twice as frequent as its d form, and l-glutamic acid was more than three times prevalent than its d counterpart. various chiral crystal surfaces can also act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules. compounds found on meteorites suggest that the chirality of life derives from abiogenic synthesis, since amino acids from meteorites show a left-handed bias, whereas sugars show a predominantly right-handed bias, the same as found in living organisms.\\n\\n\\n== self-enclosement, reproduction, duplication and the rna world ==\\n\\n\\n=== protocells ===\\n\\na protocell is a self-organized, self-ordered, spherical collection of lipids proposed as a stepping-stone to the origin of life. a central question in evolution is how simple protocells first arose and differed in reproductive contribution to the following generation driving the evolution of life. although a functional protocell has not yet been achieved in a laboratory setting, there are scientists who think the goal is well within reach.self-assembled vesicles are essential components of primitive cells. the second law of thermodynamics requires that the universe move in a direction in which entropy increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. therefore, a boundary is needed to separate life processes from non-living matter. researchers irene a. chen and jack w. szostak amongst others, suggest that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to essential cellular behaviours, including primitive forms of differential reproduction competition and energy storage. such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells. furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. such micro-encapsulation would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it. the main advantages of encapsulation include the increased solubility of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy in the form of an electrochemical gradient.\\na 2012 study led by armen y. mulkidjanian of germany\\'s university of osnabrück, suggests that inland pools of condensed and cooled geothermal vapour have the ideal characteristics for the origin of life. scientists confirmed in 2002 that by adding a montmorillonite clay to a solution of fatty acid micelles (lipid spheres), the clay sped up the rate of vesicles formation 100-fold.another protocell model is the jeewanu. first synthesized in 1963 from simple minerals and basic organics while exposed to sunlight, it is still reported to have some metabolic capabilities, the presence of semipermeable membrane, amino acids, phospholipids, carbohydrates and rna-like molecules. however, the nature and properties of the jeewanu remains to be clarified.\\nelectrostatic interactions induced by short, positively charged, hydrophobic peptides containing 7 amino acids in length or fewer, can attach rna to a vesicle membrane, the basic cell membrane.researchers tony z. jia and kuhan chandru have proposed that membraneless polyesters droplets could have been significant in the origins of life. given the \"messy\" nature of prebiotic chemistry, the spontaneous generation of these combinatorial droplets may have played a role in early cellularization before the innovation of lipid vesicles. protein function within and rna function in the presence of certain polyester droplets was shown to be preserved within the droplets. additionally, the droplets have scaffolding ability, by allowing lipids to assemble around them that may have prevented leakage of genetic materials.\\n\\n\\n=== rna world ===\\n\\nthe rna world hypothesis describes an early earth with self-replicating and catalytic rna but no dna or proteins. it is widely accepted that current life on earth descends from an rna world, although rna-based life may not have been the first life to exist. this conclusion is drawn from many independent lines of evidence, such as the observations that rna is central to the translation process and that small rnas can catalyze all of the chemical groups and information transfers required for life. the structure of the ribosome has been called the \"smoking gun,\" as it showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme, with a central core of rna and no amino acid side chains within 18 angstroms of the active site where peptide bond formation is catalyzed. the concept of the rna world was first proposed in 1962 by alexander rich, and the term was coined by walter gilbert in 1986.possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of rna. it is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of rna, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the genetic code arose.eugene koonin said, \"despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. the rna world concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient rna replicase or the translation system. the mwo [\"many worlds in one\"] version of the cosmological model of eternal inflation could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite multiverse with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable.\"\\n\\n\\n==== viral origins ====\\nrecent evidence for a \"virus first\" hypothesis, which may support theories of the rna world, has been suggested. one of the difficulties for the study of the origins of viruses is their high rate of mutation; this is particularly the case in rna retroviruses like hiv. a 2015 study compared protein fold structures across different branches of the tree of life, where researchers can reconstruct the evolutionary histories of the folds and of the organisms whose genomes code for those folds. they argue that protein folds are better markers of ancient events as their three-dimensional structures can be maintained even as the sequences that code for those begin to change. thus, the viral protein repertoire retain traces of ancient evolutionary history that can be recovered using advanced bioinformatics approaches. those researchers think that \"the prolonged pressure of genome and particle size reduction eventually reduced virocells into modern viruses (identified by the complete loss of cellular makeup), meanwhile other coexisting cellular lineages diversified into modern cells.\" the data suggest that viruses originated from ancient cells that co-existed with the ancestors of modern cells. these ancient cells likely contained segmented rna genomes. although the virus-first hypothesis is highly controversial today, some astrobiologists have suggested looking for viruses on other celestial bodies such as mars if they do emerge before cells.\\n\\n\\n=== rna synthesis and replication ===\\na number of hypotheses of formation of rna have been put forward. as of 1994, there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil. subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. these are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on clay substrates or on the surface of the mineral pyrite.\\nfactors supporting an important role for rna in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of dna) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the rna molecule under the conditions that approximated the early earth. relatively short rna molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. such replicase rna, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. jack w. szostak has shown that certain catalytic rnas can join smaller rna sequences together, creating the potential for self-replication. if these conditions were present, darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. such autocatalytic systems of rna capable of self-sustained replication have been identified. the rna replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other\\'s synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. in evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. this was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system.depending on the definition, life started when rna chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of darwinian selection: heritability, variation of type, and differential reproductive output. the fitness of an rna replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources. the three primary adaptive capacities may have been: (1) replication with moderate fidelity, giving rise to both heritability while allowing variation of type, (2) resistance to decay, and (3) acquisition of process resources. these capacities would have functioned by means of the folded configurations of the rna replicators resulting from their nucleotide sequences.\\ncarl zimmer has speculated that the chemical conditions, including the presence of boron, molybdenum and oxygen needed for the initial production of rna, may have been better on early mars than on early earth. if so, life-suitable molecules originating on mars may have later migrated to earth via meteor ejections.\\n\\n\\n=== pre-rna world ===\\nit is possible that a different type of nucleic acid, such as peptide nucleic acid, threose nucleic acid or glycol nucleic acid, was the first to emerge as a self-reproducing molecule, only later replaced by rna. larralde et al., say that \"the generally accepted prebiotic synthesis of ribose, the formose reaction, yields numerous sugars without any selectivity.\" and they conclude that their \"results suggest that the backbone of the first genetic material could not have contained ribose or other sugars because of their instability.\" the ester linkage of ribose and phosphoric acid in rna is known to be prone to hydrolysis.pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. one of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. this can be viewed as a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. photoanomerization with uv light allows for inversion about the 1\\' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. in 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2\\',3\\'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into rna. this paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2\\',3\\'-cyclic phosphates.a new origin-of-life theory based on self-replicating beta-sheet structures was recently put forward. the theory suggest that self-replicating and self-assembling catalytic amyloids were the first informational polymers in a primitive pre-rna world. the main arguments for the amyloid hypothesis is based on the structural stability, autocatalytic and catalytic properties, and evolvability of beta-sheet based informational systems. such systems are also error correcting. and chiroselective.\\n\\n\\n== origin of biological metabolism ==\\nmetabolism-like reactions could have occurred naturally in early oceans, before the first organisms evolved. metabolism may predate the origin of life, which may have evolved from the chemical conditions in the earliest oceans. reconstructions in laboratories show that some of these reactions can produce rna, and some others resemble two essential reaction cascades of metabolism: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, that provide essential precursors for nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids. a study at the university of düsseldorf created phylogenic trees based upon 6 million genes from bacteria and archaea, and identified 355 protein families that were probably present in the luca. they were based upon an anaerobic metabolism fixing carbon dioxide and nitrogen. it suggests that the luca evolved in an environment rich in hydrogen, carbon dioxide and iron. following are some observed discoveries and related hypotheses.\\n\\n\\n=== iron–sulfur world ===\\n\\nin the 1980s, günter wächtershäuser, encouraged and supported by karl r. popper, postulated his iron–sulfur world, a theory of the evolution of pre-biotic chemical pathways as the starting point in the evolution of life. it systematically traces today\\'s biochemistry to primordial reactions which provide alternative pathways to the synthesis of organic building blocks from simple gaseous compounds.\\nin contrast to the classical miller experiments, which depend on external sources of energy (simulated lightning, ultraviolet irradiation), \"wächtershäuser systems\" come with a built-in source of energy: sulfides of iron (iron pyrite) and other minerals. the energy released from redox reactions of these metal sulfides is available for the synthesis of organic molecules, and such systems may have evolved into autocatalytic sets constituting self-replicating, metabolically active entities predating the life forms known today. experiments with such sulfides in an aqueous environment at 100 °c produced a relatively small yield of dipeptides (0.4% to 12.4%) and a smaller yield of tripeptides (0.10%) although under the same conditions, dipeptides were quickly broken down.several models reject the self-replication of a \"naked-gene\", postulating instead the emergence of a primitive metabolism providing a safe environment for the later emergence of rna replication. the centrality of the krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) to energy production in aerobic organisms, and in drawing in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in biosynthesis of complex organic chemicals, suggests that it was one of the first parts of the metabolism to evolve. concordantly, geochemist michael russell has proposed that \"the purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide\" (as part of a \"metabolism-first,\" rather than a \"genetics-first,\" scenario). physicist jeremy england of mit has proposed that life was inevitable from general thermodynamic considerations: \"... when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy. this could mean that under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life.\"one of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with oparin\\'s notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of dna. variants in the 1980s and 1990s include wächtershäuser\\'s iron–sulfur world theory and models introduced by christian de duve based on the chemistry of thioesters. more abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by freeman dyson in the early 1980s and stuart kauffman\\'s notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade.\\norgel summarized his analysis by stating, \"there is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of fes/fes2 or some other mineral.\" it is possible that another type of metabolic pathway was used at the beginning of life. for example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the \"open\" acetyl-coa pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. the key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase, harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-coa (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step. there are increasing concerns, however, that prebiotic thiolated and thioester compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable to accumulate in presumed prebiotic conditions (i.e. hydrothermal vents). it has also been proposed that cysteine and homocysteine may have reacted with nitriles resulting from the stecker reaction, readily forming catalytic thiol-reach poplypeptides.\\n\\n\\n=== zn-world hypothesis ===\\nthe zn-world (zinc world) theory of armen y. mulkidjanian is an extension of wächtershäuser\\'s pyrite hypothesis. wächtershäuser based his theory of the initial chemical processes leading to informational molecules (rna, peptides) on a regular mesh of electric charges at the surface of pyrite that may have facilitated the primeval polymerization by attracting reactants and arranging them appropriately relative to each other. the zn-world theory specifies and differentiates further. hydrothermal fluids rich in h2s interacting with cold primordial ocean (or darwin\\'s \"warm little pond\") water leads to the precipitation of metal sulfide particles. oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (vms) of hydrothermal origin. they reach many kilometres in diameter and date back to the archean eon. most abundant are pyrite (fes2), chalcopyrite (cufes2), and sphalerite (zns), with additions of galena (pbs) and alabandite (mns). zns and mns have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from uv light. during the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (>100 bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the earth\\'s surface, and uv irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by zns provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.\\nthe zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and proto-eukaryotes evolved. archibald macallum noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater; however, the inorganic composition of all cells differ from that of modern seawater, which led mulkidjanian and colleagues to reconstruct the \"hatcheries\" of the first cells combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. the authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for k+, zn2+, mn2+, and phosphate. geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. under the oxygen depleted, co2-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow \"darwin ponds\" lined with porous silicate minerals mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in k+, zn2+, and phosphorus compounds.\\n\\n\\n=== deep sea vent hypothesis ===\\n\\nthe deep sea vent, or alkaline hydrothermal vent, theory posits that life may have begun at submarine hydrothermal vents, william martin and michael russell have suggested \"that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage site hydrothermal mound at a redox, ph, and temperature gradient between sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(ii)-containing waters of the hadean ocean floor. the naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. the known capability of fes and nis to catalyze the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments,...\" these form where hydrogen-rich fluids emerge from below the sea floor, as a result of serpentinization of ultra-mafic olivine with seawater and a ph interface with carbon dioxide-rich ocean water. the vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see iron–sulfur world theory. these are highly exothermic reactions.michael russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic proton motive force (pmf) chemiosmotic gradient, in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. their microscopic compartments \"provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules,\" composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as mackinawite, endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by wächtershäuser. this movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:\\n\\ndiffusion force caused by concentration gradient—all particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.\\nelectrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient—cations like protons h+ tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, anions in the opposite direction.these two gradients taken together can be expressed as an electrochemical gradient, providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. the proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential).\\njack w. szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. in 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, ignat ignatov and oleg mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. the hot mineral water that contains bicarbonate and calcium ions has the most optimal range. this case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. this water has a ph of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. according to melvin calvin, certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with ph 9–11 at a later evolutionary stage. some of these compounds like hydrocyanic acid (hcn) have been proven in the experiments of miller. this is the environment in which the stromatolites have been created. david ward of montana state university described the formation of stromatolites in hot mineral water at the yellowstone national park. stromatolites survive in hot mineral water and in proximity to areas with volcanic activity. processes have evolved in the sea near geysers of hot mineral water. in 2011, tadashi sugawara from the university of tokyo created a protocell in hot water.experimental research and computer modelling suggest that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have catalytic properties similar to those of enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as methanol (ch3oh) and formic, acetic and pyruvic acid out of the dissolved co2 in the water.the research reported above by william f. martin in july 2016 supports the thesis that life arose at hydrothermal vents, that spontaneous chemistry in the earth\\'s crust driven by rock–water interactions at disequilibrium thermodynamically underpinned life\\'s origin and that the founding lineages of the archaea and bacteria were h2-dependent autotrophs that used co2 as their terminal acceptor in energy metabolism. martin suggests, based upon this evidence that luca \"may have depended heavily on the geothermal energy of the vent to survive\".\\n\\n\\n=== thermosynthesis ===\\ntoday\\'s bioenergetic process of fermentation is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the acetyl-coa pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial iron–sulfur world. in a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of chemiosmosis, which plays an essential role in cellular respiration and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the atp synthase enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.first, life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the phosphodiester bonds of rna. in a generalization and thermal variation of the binding change mechanism of today\\'s atp synthase, the \"first protein\" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, rna \\'monomers\\') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until after a temperature change it was released by thermal unfolding.\\nthe energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a convection current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and dissipative structure required in any origin of life model. the still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.\\nby phosphorylating cell membrane lipids, this \"first protein\" gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. this protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. as proposed by dyson, it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.\\nwhereas the iron–sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: atp synthase\\'s binding change mechanism resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy, rather than a regular enzyme\\'s mechanism, which decreases the free energy. it has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts is implausible.\\n\\n\\n== other models ==\\n\\n\\n=== clay hypothesis ===\\nmontmorillonite, an abundant clay, is a catalyst for the polymerization of rna and for the formation of membranes from lipids. a model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by alexander graham cairns-smith in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists. the clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution.\\nat the rensselaer polytechnic institute, james p. ferris\\' studies have also confirmed that clay minerals of montmorillonite catalyze the formation of rna in aqueous solution, by joining nucleotides to form longer chains.in 2007, bart kahr from the university of washington and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of potassium hydrogen phthalate. \"mother\" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow \"daughter\" crystals from solution. they then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. for gene-like behaviour to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. thus kahr concluded that the crystals \"were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next.\"\\n\\n\\n=== gold\\'s \"deep-hot biosphere\" model ===\\nin the 1970s, thomas gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the earth, but several kilometres below the surface. it is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our solar system would lend significant credence to this theory. thomas gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. gold\\'s theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the earth\\'s mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.\\n\\n\\n=== panspermia ===\\n\\npanspermia is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, and, also, by spacecraft in the form of unintended contamination by microorganisms. for example, planetary contamination by organisms like tersicoccus phoenicis, which has shown resistance to methods usually used in spacecraft assembly clean rooms.the panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. the advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact. evidence for the hypothesis is scant, but it finds some support in studies of martian meteorites found in antarctica and in studies of extremophile microbes\\' survival in outer space tests. (see also: list of microorganisms tested in outer space.)\\n\\n\\n=== extraterrestrial organic molecules ===\\n\\nan organic compound is any member of a large class of gaseous, liquid, or solid chemicals whose molecules contain carbon. carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. carbon is abundant in the sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. organic compounds are relatively common in space, formed by \"factories of complex molecular synthesis\" which occur in molecular clouds and circumstellar envelopes, and chemically evolve after reactions are initiated mostly by ionizing radiation. based on computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed on dust grains in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the sun before the formation of the earth. according to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets.observations suggest that the majority of organic compounds introduced on earth by interstellar dust particles are considered principal agents in the formation of complex molecules, thanks to their peculiar surface-catalytic activities. studies reported in 2008, based on 12c/13c isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the murchison meteorite, suggested that the rna component uracil and related molecules, including xanthine, were formed extraterrestrially. on 8 august 2011, a report based on nasa studies of meteorites found on earth was published suggesting dna components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) were made in outer space. scientists also found that the cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organics (\"amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic–aliphatic structure\") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. sun kwok of the university of hong kong suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on earth said that \"if this is the case, life on earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life.\"\\n\\nglycolaldehyde, the first example of an interstellar sugar molecule, was detected in the star-forming region near the centre of our galaxy. it was discovered in 2000 by jes jørgensen and jan m. hollis. in 2012, jørgensen\\'s team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. the molecule was found around the protostellar binary iras 16293-2422 400 light years from earth. glycolaldehyde is needed to form rna, which is similar in function to dna. these findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two of the most basic aspects of life, it is thought the discovery of extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy.\\n\\nnasa announced in 2009 that scientists had identified another fundamental chemical building block of life in a comet for the first time, glycine, an amino acid, which was detected in material ejected from comet wild 2 in 2004 and grabbed by nasa\\'s stardust probe. glycine has been detected in meteorites before. carl pilcher, who leads the nasa astrobiology institute commented that \"the discovery of glycine in a comet supports the idea that the fundamental building blocks of life are prevalent in space, and strengthens the argument that life in the universe may be common rather than rare.\" comets are encrusted with outer layers of dark material, thought to be a tar-like substance composed of complex organic material formed from simple carbon compounds after reactions initiated mostly by ionizing radiation. it is possible that a rain of material from comets could have brought significant quantities of such complex organic molecules to earth. amino acids which were formed extraterrestrially may also have arrived on earth via comets. it is estimated that during the late heavy bombardment, meteorites may have delivered up to five million tons of organic prebiotic elements to earth per year.polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) are the most common and abundant of the known polyatomic molecules in the observable universe, and are considered a likely constituent of the primordial sea. in 2010, pahs, along with fullerenes (or \"buckyballs\"), have been detected in nebulae. in april 2019, scientists, working with the hubble space telescope, reported the confirmed detection of the large and complex ionized molecules of buckminsterfullerene (c60) in the interstellar medium spaces between the stars.in march 2015, nasa scientists reported that, for the first time, complex dna and rna organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. pyrimidine, like pahs, the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giant stars or in interstellar dust and gas clouds. a group of czech scientists reported that all four rna-bases may be synthesized from formamide in the course of high-energy density events like extraterrestrial impacts.\\n\\n\\n=== lipid world ===\\n\\nthe lipid world theory postulates that the first self-replicating object was lipid-like. it is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation—the same structure as in cell membranes. these molecules were not present on early earth, but other amphiphilic long-chain molecules also form membranes. furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two progenies. the main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as rna or dna that may store information favourably. studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. this in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.\\nwithin the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle, actually a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles which would have allowed darwinian natural selection.\\n\\n\\n=== polyphosphates ===\\na problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. what has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. the resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions po4−3. several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. they are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as adenosine triphosphate (atp). a key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. there has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early earth.\\n\\n\\n=== pah world hypothesis ===\\n\\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) are known to be abundant in the universe, including in the interstellar medium, in comets, and in meteorites, and are some of the most complex molecules so far found in space.other sources of complex molecules have been postulated, including extraterrestrial stellar or interstellar origin. for example, from spectral analyses, organic molecules are known to be present in comets and meteorites. in 2004, a team detected traces of pahs in a nebula. in 2010, another team also detected pahs, along with fullerenes, in nebulae. the use of pahs has also been proposed as a precursor to the rna world in the pah world hypothesis. the spitzer space telescope has detected a star, hh 46-ir, which is forming by a process similar to that by which the sun formed. in the disk of material surrounding the star, there is a very large range of molecules, including cyanide compounds, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. in september 2012, nasa scientists reported that pahs, subjected to interstellar medium conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics—\"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and dna, respectively.\" further, as a result of these transformations, the pahs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons \"for the lack of pah detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\"nasa maintains a database for tracking pahs in the universe. more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with pahs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. pahs seem to have been formed shortly after the big bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.\\n\\n\\n=== radioactive beach hypothesis ===\\nzachary adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of uranium and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life\\'s building blocks. according to computer models, a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same self-sustaining nuclear reaction as that found in the oklo uranium ore seam in gabon. such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from acetonitrile in water. radioactive monazite material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically \"accessible.\" thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to adam. radioactive actinides, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of organometallic complexes. these complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.\\njohn parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the \"crucible of life\" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. as the early earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.\\n\\n\\n=== thermodynamic dissipation ===\\nthe 19th-century austrian physicist ludwig boltzmann first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor energy, but instead had to do with entropy production derived from the conversion of the solar spectrum into heat by these systems. boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all irreversible processes, were dependent on the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. in his book \"what is life\", the 20th-century austrian physicist erwin schrödinger emphasized the importance of boltzmann\\'s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. however, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until lars onsager, and later ilya prigogine, developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the \"self-organization\" of material under a generalized chemical potential. this formalism became known as classical irreversible thermodynamics and prigogine was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1977 \"for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures\". the analysis of prigogine showed that if a system were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its entropy) forming what he called \"dissipative structures\" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of atp to optimizing bacterial metabolic pathways to complete ecosystems.in his \"thermodynamic dissipation theory of the origin and evolution of life\", karo michaelian has taken the insight of boltzmann and the work of prigogine to its ultimate consequences regarding the origin of life. this theory postulates that the hallmark of the origin and evolution of life is the microscopic dissipative structuring of organic pigments and their proliferation over the entire earth surface. present day life augments the entropy production of earth in its solar environment by dissipating ultraviolet and visible photons into heat through organic pigments in water. this heat then catalyzes a host of secondary dissipative processes such as the water cycle, ocean and wind currents, hurricanes, etc. michaelian argues that if the thermodynamic function of life today is to produce entropy through photon dissipation in organic pigments, then this probably was its function at its very beginnings. it turns out that both rna and dna when in water solution are very strong absorbers and extremely rapid dissipaters of ultraviolet light within the 230–290 nm wavelength (uv-c) region, which is a part of the sun\\'s spectrum that could have penetrated the prebiotic atmosphere. in fact, not only rna and dna, but many fundamental molecules of life (those common to all three domains of life) are also pigments that absorb in the uv-c, and many of these also have a chemical affinity to rna and dna. nucleic acids may thus have acted as acceptor molecules to the uv-c photon excited antenna pigment donor molecules by providing an ultrafast channel for dissipation. michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the archean a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic uv-c photochemical synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire earth surface if they acted as catalysts to augment the dissipation of the solar photons. by the end of the archean, with life-induced ozone dissipating uv-c light in the earth\\'s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that did not rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at earth\\'s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of covalent bonds. it has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the cambrian explosionsome of the most difficult problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less replication of rna and dna, homochirality of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of information encoding in rna and dna, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and uv-c photon dissipation. michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized thermodynamic potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.\\n\\n\\n=== multiple genesis ===\\ndifferent forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early history of earth. the other forms may be extinct (having left distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry—e.g., hypothetical types of biochemistry). it has been proposed that:\\n\\nthe first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids. this system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. if biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.\\n\\n\\n=== fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents ===\\narmid mulkidjanian and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the ionic balance and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to k+/na+ ratio, mn2+, zn2+ and phosphate concentrations. the only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on earth are found in terrestrial hydrothermal pools fed by steam vents. additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable ph (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful uv radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters and depsipeptides, both by chemical reactions in the hydrothermal environment, as well as by exposure to uv light during transport from vents to adjacent pools. their hypothesized pre-biotic environments are similar to the deep-oceanic vent environments most commonly hypothesized, but add additional components that help explain peculiarities found in reconstructions of the last universal common ancestor (luca) of all living organisms.bruce damer and david deamer have come to the conclusion that cell membranes cannot be formed in salty seawater, and must therefore have originated in freshwater. before the continents formed, the only dry land on earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. these predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a superorganism rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.colín-garcía et al. (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments. they mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. colín-garcía et al. (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\nfootnotes\\n\\ncitations\\n\\n\\n=== sources ===\\n\\n\\n== external links ==\\n\\n\"exploring life\\'s origins: a virtual exhibit\". exploring life\\'s origins: a virtual exhibit. arlington county, va: national science foundation. retrieved 2 july 2015.\\n\"the geochemical origins of life by michael j. russell & allan j. hall\". glasgow, scotland: university of glasgow. 13 december 2008. retrieved 2 july 2015.\\nmalory, marcia. \"how life began on earth\". earth facts. retrieved 2 july 2015.\\nthe origins of life, bbc radio 4 discussion with richard dawkins, richard corfield & linda partridge (in our time, 23 september 2004)\\nwinston churchill\\'s essay on evolution (c.1939/1950s)',\n",
              " 'abolitionism, or the abolitionist movement, was the movement to end slavery. this term can be used both formally and informally. in western europe and the americas, abolitionism was a historic movement that sought to end the atlantic slave trade and set slaves free. king charles i of spain, usually known as emperor charles v, was following the example of louis x of france, who had abolished slavery within the kingdom of france in 1315. he passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542, although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states, and it was not enforced as a result. in the late 17th century, the roman catholic church officially condemned the slave trade in response to a plea by lourenço da silva de mendouça, and it was also vehemently condemned by pope gregory xvi in 1839. the abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when english and american quakers began to question the morality. james oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the enlightenment case against slavery, banning it in the province of georgia on humanitarian grounds, and arguing against it in parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends granville sharp and hannah more to vigorously pursue the cause. soon after his death in 1785, sharp and more united with william wilberforce and others in forming the clapham sect.the somersett case in 1772, in which a fugitive slave was freed with the judgement that slavery did not exist under english common law, helped launch the british movement to abolish slavery. though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, the colonies and emerging nations that used slave labor continued to do so: dutch, french, british, spanish and portuguese territories in the west indies, south america, and the southern united states. after the american revolution established the united states, northern states, beginning with pennsylvania in 1780, passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual emancipation. massachusetts ratified a constitution that declared all men equal; freedom suits challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state. vermont, which existed as an unrecognized state from 1777 to 1791, abolished adult slavery in 1777. in other states, such as virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to africans and african americans. during the following decades, the abolitionist movement grew in northern states, and congress regulated the expansion of slavery in new states admitted to the union.\\nin 1787 the society for effecting the abolition of the slave trade was formed in london. revolutionary france abolished slavery throughout its empire in 1794, although it was restored in 1802 by napoleon as part of a program to ensure sovereignty over its colonies. haiti (then santo domingo) formally declared independence from france in 1804 and brought an end to slavery in its territory. the northern states in the u.s. all abolished slavery by 1804. the united kingdom (then including ireland) and the united states outlawed the international slave trade in 1807, after which britain led efforts to block slave ships. britain abolished slavery throughout its empire by the slavery abolition act 1833 (with the notable exception of india), the french colonies re-abolished it in 1848 and the u.s. abolished slavery in 1865 with the 13th amendment to the u.s. constitution.\\nin eastern europe, groups organized to abolish the enslavement of the roma in wallachia and moldavia, and to emancipate the serfs in russia. slavery was declared illegal in 1948 under the universal declaration of human rights. mauritania was the last country to abolish slavery, with a presidential decree in 1981. today, child and adult slavery and forced labour are illegal in almost all countries, as well as being against international law, but a high rate of human trafficking for labour and for sexual bondage continues to affect tens of millions of adults and children.\\n\\n\\n== france ==\\n\\n\\n=== abolition in continental france (1315) ===\\nin 1315, louis x, king of france, published a decree proclaiming that \"france signifies freedom\" and that any slave setting foot on the french ground should be freed. this prompted subsequent governments to circumscribe slavery in the overseas colonies.some cases of african slaves freed by setting foot on the french soil were recorded such as this example of a norman slave merchant who tried to sell slaves in bordeaux in 1571. he was arrested and his slaves were freed according to a declaration of the parlement of guyenne which stated that slavery was intolerable in france. born into slavery in saint domingue, thomas-alexandre dumas became free when his father brought him to france in 1776.\\n\\n\\n=== code noir and age of enlightenment ===\\n\\nas in other new world colonies, the french relied on the atlantic slave trade for labour for their sugar cane plantations in their caribbean colonies; the french west indies. in addition, french colonists in louisiane in north america held slaves, particularly in the south around new orleans, where they established sugarcane plantations.\\nlouis xiv\\'s code noir regulated the slave trade and institution in the colonies. it gave unparalleled rights to slaves. it included the right to marry, gather publicly, or take sundays off. although the code noir authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners to torture them or to separate families. it also demanded enslaved africans receive instruction in the catholic faith, implying that africans were human beings endowed with a soul, a fact french law did not admit until then. it resulted in a far higher percentage of blacks being free in 1830 (13.2% in louisiana compared to 0.8% in mississippi). they were on average exceptionally literate, with a significant number of them owning businesses, properties, and even slaves. other free people of colour, such as julien raimond, spoke out against slavery.\\nthe code noir also forbade interracial marriages, but it was often ignored in french colonial society and the mulattoes became an intermediate caste between whites and blacks, while in the british colonies mulattoes and blacks were considered equal and discriminated against equally.during the age of enlightenment, many philosophers wrote pamphlets against slavery and its moral and economical justifications, including montesquieu in the spirit of the laws (1748) and denis diderot in the encyclopédie. in 1788, jacques pierre brissot founded the society of the friends of the blacks (société des amis des noirs) to work for the abolition of slavery. after the revolution, on 4 april 1792, france granted free people of colour full citizenship.\\nthe slave revolt, in the largest caribbean french colony of saint-domingue in 1791, was the beginning of what became the haitian revolution led by formerly enslaved people like georges biassou, toussaint louverture, and jean-jacques dessalines. the rebellion swept through the north of the colony, and with it came freedom to thousands of enslaved blacks, but also violence and death. in 1793, french civil commissioners in st. domingue and abolitionists, léger-félicité sonthonax and étienne polverel, issued the first emancipation proclamation of the modern world (decree of 16 pluviôse an ii). the convention sent them to safeguard the allegiance of the population to revolutionary france. the proclamation resulted in crucial military strategy as it gradually brought most of the black troops into the french fold and kept the colony under the french flag for most of the conflict. the connection with france lasted until blacks and free people of colour formed l\\'armée indigène in 1802 to resist napoleon\\'s expédition de saint-domingue. victory over the french in the decisive battle of vertières finally led to independence and the creation of present haiti in 1804.\\n\\n\\n=== first general abolition of slavery (1794) ===\\n\\nthe convention, the first elected assembly of the first republic (1792–1804), on 4 february 1794, under the leadership of maximilien robespierre, abolished slavery in law in france and its colonies. abbé grégoire and the society of the friends of the blacks were part of the abolitionist movement, which had laid important groundwork in building anti-slavery sentiment in the metropole. the first article of the law stated that \"slavery was abolished\" in the french colonies, while the second article stated that \"slave-owners would be indemnified\" with financial compensation for the value of their slaves.  the french constitution passed in 1795 included in the declaration of the rights of man that slavery was abolished.\\n\\n\\n=== re-establishment of slavery in the colonies (1802) ===\\nduring the french revolutionary wars, french slave-owners massively joined the counter-revolution and, through the whitehall accord, they threatened to move the french caribbean colonies under british control, as great britain still allowed slavery. fearing secession from these islands, successfully lobbied by planters and concerned about revenues from the west indies, and influenced by the slaveholder family of his wife, napoleon bonaparte decided to re-establish slavery after becoming first consul. he promulgated the law of 20 may 1802 and sent military governors and troops to the colonies to impose it. on 10 may 1802, colonel delgrès launched a rebellion in guadeloupe against napoleon\\'s representative, general richepanse. the rebellion was repressed, and slavery was re-established. the news of this event sparked another wave of rebellion in saint-domingue. although from 1802, napoleon sent more than 20,000 troops to the island, two-thirds died mostly due to yellow fever. he withdrew the remaining 7,000 troops and slaves achieved an independent republic they called haïti in 1804. seeing the failure of the saint-domingue expedition, in 1803 napoleon decided to sell the louisiana territory to the united states. the french governments initially refused to recognize haiti. it forced the nation to pay a substantial amount of reparations (which it could ill afford) for losses during the revolution and did not recognize its government until 1825.\\nfrance was a signatory to the first multilateral treaty for the suppression of the slave trade, the treaty for the suppression of the african slave trade (1841), but the king, louis philippe i, declined to ratify it.\\n\\n\\n=== second abolition (1848) and subsequent events ===\\n\\non 27 april 1848, under the second republic (1848–52), the decree-law of schœlcher abolished slavery in the remaining colonies. the state bought the slaves from the colons (white colonists; békés in creole), and then freed them.\\nat about the same time, france started colonizing africa and gained possession of much of west africa by 1900. in 1905, the french abolished slavery in most of french west africa. the french also attempted to abolish tuareg slavery following the kaocen revolt. in the region of the sahel, slavery has however long persisted.\\npassed on 10 may 2001, the taubira law officially acknowledges slavery and the atlantic slave trade as a crime against humanity. 10 may was chosen as the day dedicated to recognition of the crime of slavery.\\n\\n\\n== great britain ==\\n\\nthe last known form of enforced servitude of adults (villeinage) had disappeared in england by the beginning of the 17th century. in 1569 a court considered the case of cartwright, who had bought a slave from russia. the court ruled english law could not recognize slavery, as it was never established officially. this ruling was overshadowed by later developments; it was upheld in 1700 by the lord chief justice john holt when he ruled that a slave became free as soon as he arrived in england. during the english civil wars of the mid-seventeenth century, sectarian radicals challenged slavery and other threats to personal freedom. their ideas influenced many antislavery thinkers in the eighteenth century.in addition to english colonists importing slaves to the north american colonies, by the 18th century, traders began to import slaves from africa, india and east asia (where they were trading) to london and edinburgh to work as personal servants. men who migrated to the north american colonies often took their east indian slaves or servants with them, as east indians have been documented in colonial records.some of the first freedom suits, court cases in the british isles to challenge the legality of slavery, took place in scotland in 1755 and 1769. the cases were montgomery v. sheddan (1755) and spens v. dalrymple (1769). each of the slaves had been baptized in scotland and challenged the legality of slavery. they set the precedent of legal procedure in british courts that would later lead to successful outcomes for the plaintiffs. in these cases, deaths of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, brought an end before court decisions.african slaves were not bought or sold in london but were brought by masters from other areas. together with people from other nations, especially non-christian, africans were considered foreigners, not able to be english subjects. at the time, england had no naturalization procedure. the african slaves\\' legal status was unclear until 1772 and somersett\\'s case, when the fugitive slave james somersett forced a decision by the courts. somersett had escaped, and his master, charles steuart, had him captured and imprisoned on board a ship, intending to ship him to jamaica to be resold into slavery. while in london, somersett had been baptized; three godparents issued a writ of habeas corpus. as a result, lord mansfield, chief justice of the court of the king\\'s bench, had to judge whether somersett\\'s abduction was lawful or not under english common law. no legislation had ever been passed to establish slavery in england. the case received national attention, and five advocates supported the action on behalf of somersett.\\nin his judgement of 22 june 1772, mansfield declared:\\n\\nthe state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasions, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. it is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, i cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of england; and therefore the black must be discharged.\\n\\nalthough the exact legal implications of the judgement are unclear when analysed by lawyers, the judgement was generally taken at the time to have determined that slavery did not exist under english common law and was thus prohibited in england. the decision did not apply to the british overseas territories; by then, for example, the american colonies had established slavery by positive laws. somersett\\'s case became a significant part of the common law of slavery in the english-speaking world and it helped launch the movement to abolish slavery.after reading about somersett\\'s case, joseph knight, an enslaved african who had been purchased by his master john wedderburn in jamaica and brought to scotland, left him. married and with a child, he filed a freedom suit, on the grounds that he could not be held as a slave in great britain. in the case of knight v. wedderburn (1778), wedderburn said that knight owed him \"perpetual servitude\". the court of session of scotland ruled against him, saying that chattel slavery was not recognized under the law of scotland, and slaves could seek court protection to leave a master or avoid being forcibly removed from scotland to be returned to slavery in the colonies.but at the same time, legally mandated, hereditary slavery of scots persons in scotland had existed from 1606 and continued until 1799, when colliers and salters were emancipated by an act of the parliament of great britain (39 geo.iii. c. 56). skilled workers, they were restricted to a place and could be sold with the works. a prior law enacted in 1775 (15 geo. iii. c. 28) was intended to end what the act referred to as \"a state of slavery and bondage,\" but that was ineffective, necessitating the 1799 act.\\nin the 1776 book the wealth of nations, adam smith argued for the abolition of slavery on economic grounds. smith pointed out that slavery incurred security, housing, and food costs that the use of free labor would not, and opined that free workers would be more productive because they would have personal economic incentives to work harder. the death rate (and thus repurchase cost) of slaves was also high, and people are less productive when not allowed to choose the type of work they prefer, are illiterate, and are forced to live and work in miserable and unhealthy conditions. the free labor markets and international free trade that smith preferred would also result in different prices and allocations that smith believed would be more efficient and productive for consumers.\\n\\n\\n=== british empire ===\\n\\nprior to the american revolution, there were significant initiatives in the american colonies that led to the abolitionist movement. benjamin kent was the lawyer who took on most of the cases of slaves suing their masters for personal illegal enslavement. he was the first lawyer to successfully establish a slave\\'s freedom. in addition, brigadier general samuel birch created the book of negroes, to establish which slaves were free after the war.\\nin 1783, an anti-slavery movement began among the british public to end slavery throughout the british empire. in 1785, the english poet william cowper wrote:\\n\\nafter the formation of the committee for the abolition of the slave trade in 1787, william wilberforce led the cause of abolition through the parliamentary campaign. thomas clarkson became the group\\'s most prominent researcher, gathering vast amounts of data on the trade. one aspect of abolitionism during this period was the effective use of images such as the famous josiah wedgwood \"am i not a man and a brother?\" anti-slavery medallion of 1787.  clarkson described the medallion as \"promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom\". the slave trade act was passed by the british parliament on 25 march 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the british empire. britain used its influence to coerce other countries to agree to treaties to end their slave trade and allow the royal navy to seize their slave ships. britain enforced the abolition of the trade because the act made trading slaves within british territories illegal. however, the act repealed the amelioration act 1798 which attempted to improve conditions for slaves. the end of the slave trade did not end slavery as a whole. slavery was still a common practice.\\n\\nin the 1820s, the abolitionist movement revived to campaign against the institution of slavery itself. in 1823 the first anti-slavery society was founded. many of its members had previously campaigned against the slave trade. on 28 august 1833, the slavery abolition act was given royal assent, which paved the way for the abolition of slavery throughout the british empire, which was substantially achieved in 1838. in 1839, the british and foreign anti-slavery society was formed by joseph sturge, which attempted to outlaw slavery worldwide and also to pressure the government to help enforce the suppression of the slave trade by declaring slave traders to be pirates. the world\\'s oldest international human rights organization, it continues today as anti-slavery international. thomas clarkson was the key speaker at the world anti-slavery convention it held in london in 1840. in 1846 clarkson was host to frederick douglass, a prominent african-american abolitionist, on his first visit to england. at risk after passage in the us of the fugitive slave law of 1850, douglass became legally free in england when british friends raised the money and purchased his freedom from his american owner.\\n\\n\\n== moldavia and wallachia ==\\n\\nin the principalities of wallachia and moldavia, the government held slavery of the roma (often referred to as gypsies) as legal at the beginning of the 19th century. the progressive pro-european and anti-ottoman movement, which gradually gained power in the two principalities, also worked to abolish that slavery. between 1843 and 1855, the principalities emancipated all of the 250,000 enslaved roma people.\\n\\n\\n== tunisia ==\\n\\nahmad i ibn mustafa, bey (leader) of tunis, started measures to abolish slavery in tunisia in 1841. then, slavery was completely abolished in 1846.\\n\\n\\n== in the americas ==\\n\\nbartolomé de las casas was a 16th-century spanish dominican priest, the first resident bishop of chiapas (central america, today mexico). as a settler in the new world he witnessed and opposed the poor treatment and virtual slavery of the native americans by the spanish colonists, under the encomienda system. he advocated before king charles v, holy roman emperor on behalf of rights for the natives.\\nlas casas for 20 years worked to get african slaves imported to replace natives; african slavery was everywhere and no one talked of ridding the new world of it, though france had abolished slavery in france itself and there was talk in other countries about doing the same. in fact, from a purely economic point of view africans were better slaves, stronger and healthier, because the \"middle passage\" had selected for these traits. however, las casas had a late change of heart, and became an advocate for the africans in the colonies.his book, a short account of the destruction of the indies, contributed to spanish passage of colonial legislation known as the new laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in european colonial history. it ultimately led to the valladolid debate, the first european debate about the rights of colonized people.\\n\\n\\n=== latin america ===\\n\\nduring the early 19th century, slavery expanded rapidly in brazil, cuba, and the united states, while at the same time the new republics of mainland spanish america became committed to the gradual abolition of slavery.  during the spanish american wars for independence (1810–1826), slavery was abolished in most of latin america, though it continued until 1873 in puerto rico, 1886 in cuba, and 1888 in brazil (where it was abolished by the lei áurea, the \"golden law\"). chile declared freedom of wombs in 1811, followed by the united provinces of the river plate in 1813, colombia and venezuela in 1821, but without abolishing slavery completely. while chile abolished slavery in 1823, argentina did so with the signing of the argentine constitution of 1853. colombia abolished slavery in 1851.  slavery was abolished in uruguay during the guerra grande, by both the government of fructuoso rivera and the government in exile of manuel oribe.\\n\\n\\n=== canada ===\\n\\nthroughout the growth of slavery in the american south, nova scotia became a destination for black refugees leaving southern colonies and united states via the underground railroad. while many blacks who arrived in nova scotia during the american revolution were free, others were not. black slaves also arrived in nova scotia as the property of white american loyalists. in 1772, prior to the american revolution, britain outlawed the slave trade in the british isles followed by the knight v. wedderburn decision in scotland in 1778. this decision, in turn, influenced the colony of nova scotia.  in 1788, abolitionist james drummond macgregor from pictou published the first anti-slavery literature in canada and began purchasing slaves\\' freedom and chastising his colleagues in the presbyterian church who owned slaves. in 1790 john burbidge freed his slaves.  led by richard john uniacke, in 1787, 1789 and again on 11 january 1808, the nova scotian legislature refused to legalize slavery. two chief justices, thomas andrew lumisden strange (1790–1796) and sampson salter blowers (1797–1832) were instrumental in freeing slaves from their owners in nova scotia. they were held in high regard in the colony. by the end of the war of 1812 and the arrival of the black refugees, there were few slaves left in nova scotia. the slave trade act outlawed the slave trade in the british empire in 1807 and the slavery abolition act of 1833 outlawed slavery all together.\\nwith slaves escaping to new york and new england, legislation for gradual emancipation was passed in upper canada (1793) and lower canada (1803). in upper canada the assembly ruled that no slaves could be imported; slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into upper canada, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at the age of 25. under the auspices of john graves simcoe, the act against slavery of 1793 was legislated, and was the first legislation passed opposing slavery in the british empire. in practice however, some slaves continued to live in bondage until abolished in the entire british empire in the 1830s.\\n\\n\\n=== united states ===\\n\\nthe historian james m. mcpherson defines an abolitionist \"as one who before the civil war had agitated for the immediate, unconditional, and total abolition of slavery in the united states\". he does not include antislavery activists such as abraham lincoln or the republican party, which called for the gradual ending of slavery.the first attempts to end slavery in the british/american colonies came from thomas jefferson and some of his contemporaries. despite the fact that jefferson was a lifelong slaveholder, he included strong anti-slavery language in the original draft of the declaration of independence, but other delegates took it out. benjamin franklin, also a slaveholder for much of his life, became a leading member of the pennsylvania society for the abolition of slavery, the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the united states. following the american revolutionary war, northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the 1777 constitution of vermont, followed by pennsylvania\\'s gradual emancipation act in 1780. other states with more of an economic interest in slaves, such as new york and new jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, and by 1804, all the northern states had abolished it, although this did not mean that existing slaves were freed. some had to work without wages as \"indentured servants\" for two more decades, although they could no longer be sold.\\nalso in the post-revolutionary years, individual slaveholders, especially in the upper south, manumitted slaves, sometimes in their wills. (in the deep south manumission was made difficult; in south carolina every manumission required legislative approval, and the freed slaves had to leave the state immediately.) many noted that they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. the number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than one percent to nearly ten percent from 1790 to 1810 in the upper south as a result of these actions.\\nas president, on 2 march 1807, jefferson signed the act prohibiting importation of slaves and it took effect in 1808, which was the earliest allowed under the constitution. in 1820 he privately supported the missouri compromise, believing it would help to end slavery. he left the anti-slavery struggle to younger men after that.\\n in his 1821 autobiography, he wrote \"nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate, then these people are to be free; nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government.\" in an 1824 letter, jefferson lamented that the nation could not find a practical way to abolish slavery, writing \"but as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.\"in the 1850s in the fifteen states constituting the american south, slavery was legally established. while it was fading away in the cities as well as in the border states, it remained strong in plantation areas that grew cotton for export, or sugar, tobacco, or hemp. according to the 1860 united states census, the slave population in the united states had grown to four million. american abolitionism was based in the north, although there were anti-abolitionist riots in several cities. in the south abolitionism was illegal, and abolitionist publications, like the liberator, could not be sent to southern post offices. amos dresser, a white alumnus of lane theological seminary, was publicly whipped in nashville, tennessee for possessing abolitionist publications.abolitionism in the united states became a popular expression of moralism, operating in tandem with other social reform efforts, such as the temperance movement, and much more problematically, the women\\'s suffrage movement.\\nthe white abolitionist movement in the north was led by social reformers, especially william lloyd garrison, founder of the american anti-slavery society; writers such as john greenleaf whittier and harriet beecher stowe. black activists included former slaves such as frederick douglass; and free blacks such as the brothers charles henry langston and john mercer langston, who helped found the ohio anti-slavery society. some abolitionists said that slavery was criminal and a sin; they also criticized slave owners of using black women as concubines and taking sexual advantage of them.the republican party wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. southern leaders said that the republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the west made them second-class citizens, and they also said it challenged their autonomy. with the 1860 presidential victory of abraham lincoln, seven deep south states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. the american civil war broke out in april 1861 with the firing on fort sumter in south carolina. when lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded. meanwhile, four slave states (maryland, missouri, delaware, and kentucky) chose to remain in the union.\\n\\n\\n==== civil war and final emancipation ====\\n\\non 16 april 1862, abraham lincoln signed the district of columbia compensated emancipation act, abolishing slavery in washington d. c.  later on, lincoln\\'s emancipation proclamation was an executive order of the u.s. government issued on 1 january 1863, changing the legal status of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". slaves were legally freed by the proclamation and became actually free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. many served the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses, and laborers. plantation owners, realizing the emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the union army. by \"juneteenth\" (19 june 1865, in texas), the union army controlled all of the confederacy and liberated all its slaves. the owners were never compensated, nor were freed slaves compensated by former owners.the border states were exempt from the emancipation proclamation, but they too (except delaware) began their own emancipation programmes. when the union army entered confederate areas, thousands of slaves escaped to freedom behind union army lines, and in 1863 many men started serving as the united states colored troops.\\nas the war dragged on, both the federal government and union states continued to take measures against slavery.  in june 1864, the fugitive slave act of 1850, which required free states to aid in returning escaped slaves to slave states, was repealed.  the state of maryland abolished slavery on 13 october 1864.  missouri abolished slavery on 11 january 1865.  west virginia, which had been admitted to the union in 1863 as a slave state, but on the condition of gradual emancipation, fully abolished slavery on 3 february 1865.  the 13th amendment to the u.s. constitution took effect in december 1865, 7 months after the end of the war, and finally ended slavery throughout the united states. it also abolished slavery among the indian tribes, including the alaska tribes that became part of the u.s. in 1867.\\n\\n\\n== notable abolitionists ==\\n\\nwhite and black opponents of slavery, who played a considerable role in the movement. this

states:\\n\\nno one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.\\nalthough outlawed in most countries, slavery is nonetheless practised secretly in many parts of the world.  enslavement still takes place in the united states, europe, and latin america, as well as parts of africa, the middle east, and south asia. there are an estimated 27 million victims of slavery worldwide. in mauritania alone, estimates are that up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are enslaved.  many of them are used as bonded labour.modern-day abolitionists have emerged over the last several years, as awareness of slavery around the world has grown, with groups such as anti-slavery international, the american anti-slavery group, international justice mission, and free the slaves working to rid the world of slavery.\\nin the united states, the action group to end human trafficking and modern-day slavery is a coalition of ngos, foundations and corporations working to develop a policy agenda for abolishing slavery and human trafficking.  since 1997, the united states department of justice has, through work with the coalition of immokalee workers, prosecuted six individuals in florida on charges of slavery in the agricultural industry.  these prosecutions have led to freedom for over 1000 enslaved workers in the tomato and orange fields of south florida.  this is only one example of the contemporary fight against slavery worldwide.  slavery exists most widely in agricultural labour, apparel and sex industries, and service jobs in some regions.in 2000, the united states passed the victims of trafficking and violence protection act (tvpa) \"to combat trafficking in persons, especially into the sex trade, slavery, and involuntary servitude.\" the tvpa also \"created new law enforcement tools to strengthen the prosecution and punishment of traffickers, making human trafficking a federal crime with severe penalties.\"in 2014, for the first time in history major anglican, catholic, and orthodox christian leaders, as well as jewish, muslim, hindu, and buddhist leaders, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020. the signatories were: pope francis, mātā amṛtānandamayī (also known as amma), bhikkhuni thich nu chân không (representing zen master thích nhất hạnh), datuk k. sri dhammaratana, chief high priest of malaysia, rabbi and rector of the seminario rabínico

omar abboud, justin welby, archbishop of canterbury, and metropolitan emmanuel of france (representing ecumenical patriarch bartholomew.)the united states department of state publishes the annual trafficking in persons report, identifying countries as either tier 1, tier 2, tier 2 watch list or tier 3, depending upon three factors: \"(1) the extent to which the country is a country of origin, transit, or destination for severe forms of trafficking; (2) the extent to which the government of the country does not comply with the tvpa\\'s minimum standards including, in particular, the extent of the government\\'s trafficking-related corruption; and (3) the resources and capabilities of the government to address and eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons.\"though their claim has

              " 'abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. an abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. when deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently \"induced miscarriage\". the unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. a similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a \"late termination of pregnancy\" or less accurately as a \"late term abortion\".when properly done, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death, especially in the developing world. making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. it is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the united states. modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. the drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. the most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device. birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. when performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. in contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. the world health organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women.around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. as of 2008, 40% of the world\\'s women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or through other traditional methods. abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. in some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman\\'s health, or incest. there is debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life, and they may compare abortion to murder. those who support the legality of abortion often hold that it is part of a woman\\'s right to make decisions about her own body. others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.\\n\\n\\n== types ==\\n\\n\\n=== induced ===\\nan induced abortion may be classified as therapeutic (done in response to a health condition of the women or fetus) or elective (chosen for other reasons).approximately 205 million pregnancies occur each year worldwide. over a third are unintended and about a fifth end in induced abortion. most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. in the united kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus. a pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. the manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses. specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor or a woman\\'s personal preference.\\nreasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. an abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman; to prevent harm to the woman\\'s physical or mental health; to terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of mortality or morbidity; or to selectively reduce the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy. an abortion is referred to as an elective or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons. confusion sometimes arises over the term \"elective\" because \"elective surgery\" generally refers to all scheduled surgery, whether medically necessary or not.\\n\\n\\n=== spontaneous ===\\n\\nmiscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion, is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the 24th week of gestation. a pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a live-born infant is a \"premature birth\" or a \"preterm birth\". when a fetus dies in utero after viability, or during delivery, it is usually termed \"stillborn\". premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.only 30% to 50% of conceptions progress past the first trimester. the vast majority of those that do not progress are lost before the woman is aware of the conception, and many pregnancies are lost before medical practitioners can detect an embryo. between 15% and 30% of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman. 80% of these spontaneous abortions happen in the first trimester.the most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus, accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses. other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus. advancing maternal age and a woman\\'s history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion. a spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide.\\n\\n\\n== methods ==\\n\\n\\n=== medical ===\\n\\nmedical abortions are those induced by abortifacient pharmaceuticals. medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and the antiprogestogen mifepristone (also known as ru-486) in the 1980s.the most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with misoprostol (or sometimes another prostaglandin analog, gemeprost) up to 10 weeks (70 days) gestational age, methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone. mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone. this regime is effective in the second trimester. medical abortion regiments involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 70 days\\' gestation.in very early abortions, up to 7 weeks gestation, medical abortion using a mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimen is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration), especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue. early medical abortion regimens using mifepristone, followed 24–48 hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98% effective up to 9 weeks gestational age; from 9 to 10 weeks efficacy decreases modestly to 94%. if medical abortion fails, surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure.early medical abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in britain, france, switzerland, and the nordic countries. in the united states, the percentage of early medical abortions performed in non-hospital facilities is 31% as of 2014.medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog are the most common methods used for second-trimester abortions in canada, most of europe, china and india, in contrast to the united states where 96% of second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation.\\n\\n\\n=== surgical ===\\n\\nup to 15 weeks\\' gestation, suction-aspiration or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion. manual vacuum aspiration (mva) consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (eva) uses an electric pump. these techniques can both be used very early in pregnancy. mva can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the u.s. eva can be used later.mva, also known as \"mini-suction\" and \"menstrual extraction\" or eva can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required. dilation and curettage (d&c) refers to opening the cervix (dilation) and removing tissue (curettage) via suction or sharp instruments. d&c is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. the world health organization recommends sharp curettage only when suction aspiration is unavailable.dilation and evacuation (d&e), used after 12 to 16 weeks, consists of opening the cervix and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction. d&e is performed vaginally and does not require an incision. intact dilation and extraction(d&x) refers to a variant of d&e sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons.abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. it requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy.  gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy.  hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than d&e or induction abortion.first-trimester procedures can generally be performed using local anesthesia, while second-trimester methods may require deep sedation or general anesthesia.\\n\\n\\n=== labor induction abortion ===\\nin places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary. this is sometimes called \"induced miscarriage\". this procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. although it is very uncommon in the united states, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor-induced abortions in sweden and other nearby countries.only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction. unlike d&e, labor-induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. for this reason, labor-induced abortion is legally risky in the united states.\\n\\n\\n=== other methods ===\\nhistorically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine. among these are: tansy, pennyroyal, black cohosh, and the now-extinct silphium.in 1978 one woman in colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an abortion by taking pennyroyal oil.\\nbecause the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as multiple organ failure, such use is not recommended by physicians.\\nabortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. the degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage. in southeast asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage. one of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of angkor wat in cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld.reported methods of unsafe, self-induced abortion include misuse of misoprostol and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. these and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called \"induced miscarriage\".  such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available.\\n\\n\\n== safety ==\\n\\nthe health risks of abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely. the world health organization defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities. legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine. in the united states as of 2012, abortion was estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth. cdc estimated in 2019 that us pregnancy-related mortality was 17.2 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, while the us abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. in the uk, guidelines of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists state that \"women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. a 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" in indonesia in 2000 it was estimated that 2 million pregnancies ended in abortion, 4.5 million pregnancies were carried to term, and 14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion.in the us from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions. the risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days\\' gestation as it before 63 days.there is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 10 weeks gestation. medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion.vacuum aspiration in the first trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a primary care office, abortion clinic, or hospital. complications, which are rare, can include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate. infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the united states. the rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion in the first trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office. preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before abortion procedures, as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection; however, antibiotics are not routinely given with abortion pills. the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid-level practitioner. complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen. second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated.some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion groups,\\nbut lack scientific support. for example, the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively. major medical and scientific bodies (including the world health organization, national cancer institute, american cancer society, royal college of obgyn and american congress of obgyn) have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer.in the past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe. referring to the u.s., historian linda gordon states: \"in fact, illegal abortions in this country have an impressive safety record.\" according to rickie solinger,\\n\\na related myth, promulgated by a broad spectrum of people concerned about abortion and public policy, is that before legalization abortionists were dirty and dangerous back-alley butchers.... [t]he historical evidence does not support such claims.\\nauthors jerome bates and edward zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the eastern u.s. in the early 20th century who was proud of having successfully completed 13,844 abortions without any fatality.\\nin 1870s new york city the famous abortionist/midwife madame restell (anna trow lohman) appears to have lost very few women among her more than 100,000 patients—a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time. in 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology frederick j. taussig wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the u.s. was that\\n\\nwith each decade of the past fifty years the actual and proportionate frequency of this accident [perforation of the uterus] has increased, due, first, to the increase in the number of instrumentally induced abortions; second, to the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives; and, third, to the prevailing tendency to use instruments instead of the finger in emptying the uterus.\\n\\n\\n=== mental health ===\\n\\ncurrent evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortions and mental-health problems other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy. a report by the american psychological association concluded that a woman\\'s first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trimester, with such women no more likely to have mental-health problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term; the mental-health outcome of a woman\\'s second or greater abortion is less certain. some older reviews concluded that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems; however, they did not use an appropriate control group.although some studies show negative mental-health outcomes in women who choose abortions after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities, more rigorous research would be needed to show this conclusively. some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as a separate condition called \"post-abortion syndrome\", but this is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the united states.a long term-study among us women found that about 99% of women felt that they made the right decision five years after they had an abortion. relief was the primary emotion with few women feeling sadness or guilt. social stigma was a main factor predicting negative emotions and regret  years later.\\n\\n\\n=== unsafe abortion ===\\n\\nwomen seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods, especially when abortion is legally restricted. they may attempt self-induced abortion or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities. this can lead to severe complications, such as incomplete abortion, sepsis, hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs.unsafe abortions are a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide. although data are imprecise, it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually, with 97% taking place in developing countries. unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of injuries. estimates of deaths vary according to methodology, and have ranged from 37,000 to 70,000 in the past decade; deaths from unsafe abortion account for around 13% of all maternal deaths. the world health organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s. to reduce the number of unsafe abortions, public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legalization of abortion, training of medical personnel, and ensuring access to reproductive-health services. in response, opponents of abortion point out that abortion bans in no way affect prenatal care for women who choose to carry their fetus to term. the dublin declaration on maternal health, signed in 2012, notes, \"the prohibition of abortion does not affect, in any way, the availability of optimal care to pregnant women.\"a major factor in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the legal standing of abortion. countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to those where abortion is legal and available. for example, the 1996 legalization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion-related complications, with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than 90%. similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberalized their abortion laws, such as romania and nepal. a 2011 study concluded that in the united states, some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state. the analysis, however, did not take into account travel to other states without such laws to obtain an abortion. in addition, a lack of access to effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. it has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by up to 75% (from 20 million to 5 million annually) if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally. rates of such abortions may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as miscarriage, \"induced miscarriage\", \"menstrual regulation\", \"mini-abortion\", and \"regulation of a delayed/suspended menstruation\".forty percent of the world\\'s women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits, while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical, mental, or socioeconomic criteria. while maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortalities worldwide, though this varies by region. secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women. the rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon.\\n\\n\\n=== live birth ===\\nin 2019, a us senate bill entitled the \"born-alive abortion survivors protection act\" raised the issue of live birth after abortion. the bill would mandate that medical providers resuscitate neonates delivered showing signs of life during an abortion process. during the debate around this issue, us republicans falsely alleged that medical providers \"execute\" live-born babies. existing us laws would punish execution as homicide. furthermore, us abortion experts refute the claim that a \"born-alive\" fetus is a common event and reject laws that would mandate resuscitation against the wishes of the parents.only 1.3% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy in the us. although it is very uncommon, women undergoing surgical abortion after this gestational age sometimes give birth to a fetus that may survive briefly. the periviable period is considered to be between 20 and 25 weeks gestation. long-term survival is possible after 22 weeks. however, odds of long-term survival between 22 and 23 weeks are 2–3 percent and odds of survival between 23 and 24 weeks are 20 percent. \"intact survival\", which means survival of a neonate without subsequent damage to organs such as the brain or bowel is 1% at 22 weeks and 13% at 23 weeks. survival odds increase with increasing gestational age.if medical staff observe signs of life, they may be required to provide care: emergency medical care if the child has a good chance of survival and palliative care if not. induced fetal demise before termination of pregnancy after 20–21 weeks gestation is recommended by some sources to avoid this and to comply with the us partial birth abortion ban. induced fetal demise does not improve the safety of an abortion procedure and may incur risks to the health of the woman having the abortion.\\n\\n\\n== incidence ==\\nthere are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:\\n\\nabortion rate – number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age\\nabortion percentage – number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages)in many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable. for this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.the number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. the abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women, though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries. the same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.on average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. however, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. the unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the guttmacher institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide.the rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. according to the report of employees of guttmacher institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (germany and switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. the proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (israel, the netherlands and switzerland) to 30% (estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in hungary and romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.an american study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the birth control pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage. the guttmacher institute estimated that \"most abortions in the united states are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\".the abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (tar).\\n\\n\\n=== gestational age and method ===\\n\\nabortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. in 2003, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the united states were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks\\' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. 91% of these were classified as having been done by \"curettage\" (suction-aspiration, dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation), 8% by \"medical\" means (mifepristone), >1% by \"intrauterine instillation\" (saline or prostaglandin), and 1% by \"other\" (including hysterotomy and hysterectomy). according to the cdc, due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.the guttmacher institute estimated there were 2,200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the us during 2000; this accounts for <0.2% of the total number of abortions performed that year. similarly, in england and wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 and 19 weeks, and 2% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by d&e, and 30% were medical. there are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as china, india and vietnam than in developed countries.\\n\\n\\n== motivation ==\\n\\n\\n=== personal ===\\n\\nthe reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world. some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, and the wish to complete education or advance a career. additional reasons include not being willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.\\n\\n\\n=== societal ===\\nsome abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. these might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race, disapproval of single or early motherhood, stigmatization of people with disabilities, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward population control (such as china\\'s one-child policy). these factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex-selective abortion.\\n\\n\\n=== maternal and fetal health ===\\nan additional factor is maternal health which was listed as the main reason by about a third of women in 3 of 27 countries and about 7% of women in a further 7 of these 27 countries.in the u.s., the supreme court decisions in roe v. wade and doe v. bolton: \"ruled that the state\\'s interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their \"medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" on the same day that the court decided roe, it also decided doe v. bolton, in which the court defined health very broadly: \"the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman\\'s age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. all these factors may relate to health. this allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment.\"public opinion shifted in america following television personality sherri finkbine\\'s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to thalidomide. unable to obtain a legal abortion in the united states, she traveled to sweden. from 1962 to 1965, an outbreak of german measles left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. in 1967, the american medical association publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. a national opinion research center poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mother\\'s life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.\\n\\n\\n==== cancer ====\\nthe rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. this is particularly true for cervical cancer, the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment \"cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen)\". very early stage cervical cancers (i and iia) may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, radiation therapy, or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because lumpectomy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mastectomy unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. treatment with more than 40 gy of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly, and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. exposures above 0.005–0.025 gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in iq. it is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.the process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk. \"vaginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels, haemorrhage, cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site, while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment.\"\\n\\n\\n== history and religion ==\\n\\n \\nsince ancient times abortions have been done using a number of methods, including herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other traditional methods. induced abortion has long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as china under shennong (c. 2700 bce), ancient egypt with its ebers papyrus (c. 1550 bce), and the roman empire in the time of juvenal (c. 200 ce). one of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at angkor wat (c. 1150). found in a series of friezes that represent judgment after death in hindu and buddhist culture, it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion.some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the hippocratic oath forbade ancient greek physicians from performing abortions; other scholars disagree with this interpretation, and state that the medical texts of hippocratic corpus contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the oath. the physician scribonius largus wrote in 43 ce that the hippocratic oath prohibits abortion, as did soranus, although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly at the time. according to soranus\\' 1st or 2nd century ce work gynaecology, one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the hippocratic oath; the other party—to which he belonged—was willing to prescribe abortions, but only for the sake of the mother\\'s health. aristotle, in his treatise on government politics (350 bce), condemns infanticide as a means of population control. he preferred abortion in such cases, with the restriction \"[that it] must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive\".in christianity, pope sixtus v (1585–90) was the first pope before 1869 to declare that abortion is homicide regardless of the stage of pregnancy; and his pronouncement of 1588 was reversed three years later by his successor. through most of its history the catholic church was divided on whether it believed that early abortion was murder, and it did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century. several historians have written that prior to the 19th century most catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before \"quickening\" or \"ensoulment\" as an abortion. from 1750, excommunication became the punishment for abortions. statements made in 1992 in the catechism of the catholic church, the codified summary of the church\\'s teachings, opposed abortion.a 1995 survey reported that catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy, protestants are less likely to do so, and evangelical christians are the least likely to do so. islamic tradition has traditionally permitted abortion until a point in time when muslims believe the soul enters the fetus, considered by various theologians to be at conception, 40 days after conception, 120 days after conception, or quickening. however, abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high islamic faith such as the middle east and north africa.in europe and north america, abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century. however, conservatism by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe abortion techniques. other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services, and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century, when the practice (sometimes called restellism) was banned in both the united states and the united kingdom. church groups as well as physicians were highly influential in anti-abortion movements. in the us, according to some sources, abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer. however, other sources maintain that in the 19th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe.\\nin addition, some commentators have written that, despite improved medical procedures, the period from the 1930s until legalization also saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws, and concomitantly an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime.soviet russia (1919), iceland (1935) and sweden (1938) were among the first countries to legalize certain or all forms of abortion. in 1935 nazi germany, a law was passed permitting abortions for those deemed \"hereditarily ill\", while women considered of german stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions. beginning in the second half of the twentieth century, abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries.\\n\\n\\n== society and culture ==\\n\\n\\n=== abortion debate ===\\n\\ninduced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems. opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights, governmental authority, and women\\'s rights.\\nin both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion. the world medical association declaration on therapeutic abortion notes, \"circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated.\" abortion debates, especially pertaining to abortion laws, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as \"pro-life\" while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as \"pro-choice\". generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human person with a right to live, making abortion morally the same as murder. the latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights, especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.\\n\\n\\n=== modern abortion law ===\\n\\ncurrent laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. religious, moral, and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to security of person, and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.\\nin jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman\\'s consent is considered feticide). these requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the u.s., on a doctor\\'s evaluation of the fetus\\' viability. some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion. other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus\\' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including \"risks\" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. many restrictions are waived in emergency situations. china, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy.other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. these circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus\\' development is impaired, the woman\\'s physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship. in countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as nicaragua, medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors\\' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies. some countries, such as bangladesh, that nominally ban abortion, may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene. this is also a terminology in traditional medicine. in places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma, pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies. women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves.the organization women on waves, has been providing education about medical abortions since 1999. the ngo created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container, which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws. because the ships are registered in the netherlands, dutch law prevails when the ship is in international waters. while in port, the organization provides free workshops and education; while in international waters, medical personnel are legally able to prescribe medical abortion drugs and counseling.\\n\\n\\n=== sex-selective abortion ===\\n\\nsonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. the development of this technology has led to sex-selective abortion, or the termination of a fetus based on sex. the selective termination of a female fetus is most common.\\nsex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in taiwan, south korea, india, and china. this deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex-selective abortion or even sex-screening. in china, a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the one-child policy, which was enacted in 1979.many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex-selective abortion. at the international conference on population and development in 1994 over 180 states agreed to eliminate \"all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference\", conditions also condemned by a pace resolution in 2011. the world health organization and unicef, along with other united nations agencies, have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are much less effective at reducing sex-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality.\\n\\n\\n=== anti-abortion violence ===\\n\\nin a number of cases, abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, arson, and bombing. anti-abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism. in the u.s. and canada, over 8,000 incidents of violence, trespassing, and death threats have been recorded by providers since 1977, including over 200 bombings/arsons and hundreds of assaults. the majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts.\\nin the united states, four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered: david gunn (1993), john britton (1994), barnett slepian (1998), and george tiller (2009). also murdered, in the u.s. and australia, have been other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards such as james barrett, shannon lowney, lee ann nichols, and robert sanderson. woundings (e.g., garson romalis) and attempted murders have also taken place in the united states and canada. hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred. notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include eric robert rudolph, scott roeder, shelley shannon, and paul jennings hill, the first person to be executed in the united states for murdering an abortion provider.legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal. these laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.\\nfar more common than physical violence is psychological pressure. in 2003, chris danze organized anti-abortion organizations throughout texas to prevent the construction of a planned parenthood facility in austin. the organizations released the personal information online, of those involved with construction, sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacting their churches. some protestors record women entering clinics on camera.\\n\\n\\n== other animals ==\\n\\nspontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. for example, in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion, such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs. in cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as brucellosis or campylobacter, but can often be controlled by vaccination. eating pine needles can also induce abortions in cows.\\nseveral plants, including broomweed, skunk cabbage, poison hemlock, and tree tobacco, are known to cause fetal deformities and abortion in cattle and in sheep and goats. in horses, a fetus may be aborted or resorbed if it has lethal white syndrome (congenital intestinal aganglionosis). foal embryos that are homozygous for the dominant white gene (ww) are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth. in many species of sharks and rays, stress-induced abortions occur frequently on capture.viral infection can cause abortion in dogs. cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons, including hormonal imbalance. a combined abortion and spaying is performed on pregnant cats, especially in trap-neuter-return programs, to prevent unwanted kittens from being born.\\nfemale rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy, known as the bruce effect.abortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of animal husbandry. for example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals. feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation, although the frequency in the wild has been questioned. male gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.\\n\\n\\n== notes ==\\n\\n\\n== references

              " 'abraham (né abram) is the common patriarch of christianity, islam, judaism, and some other religions. in judaism, he is the founding father of the covenant of the pieces, the special relationship between the hebrews and god; in christianity, he is the prototype of all believers, jewish or gentile; and in islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with adam and culminates in muhammad.the narrative in the book of genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land. abraham is called by god to leave the house of his father terah and settle in the land originally given to canaan but which god now promises to abraham and his progeny. various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after abraham; and, while promises are made to ishmael about founding a great nation, isaac, abraham\\'s son by his half-sister sarah, inherits god\\'s promises to abraham. abraham purchases a tomb (the cave of the patriarchs) at hebron to be sarah\\'s grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the canaanites out of any inheritance. abraham later marries keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside sarah, it is isaac who receives \"all abraham\\'s goods\", while the other sons receive only \"gifts\" (genesis 25:5–8).the abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time, and it is widely agreed that the patriarchal age, along with the exodus and the period of the judges, is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history. a common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early persian period (late 6th century bce) as a result of tensions between jewish landowners who had stayed in judah during the babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their \"father abraham\", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on moses and the exodus tradition.\\n\\n\\n== biblical account ==\\n\\n\\n=== origins and calling ===\\nterah, the ninth in descent from noah, was the father of three sons: abram, nahor, and haran. the entire family, including grandchildren, lived in ur of the chaldees. according to a midrash, abram worked in terah\\'s idol shop in his youth. haran was the father of lot, and thus lot was abram\\'s nephew. haran died in his native city, ur of the chaldees.\\nabram married sarah (sarai), who was barren. terah, with abram, sarai, and lot, then departed for canaan, but settled in a place named haran, where terah died at the age of 205.[genesis 11:27–32] god had told abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him.[genesis 12:1–3] abram was 75 years old when he left haran with his wife sarai, his nephew lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to shechem in canaan.[genesis 12:4–6]\\n\\n\\n=== sarai ===\\nthere was a severe famine in the land of canaan, so that abram and lot and their households, traveled to egypt. on the way abram told sarai to say that she was his sister, so that the egyptians would not kill him.[genesis 12:10–13] when they entered egypt, the pharaoh\\'s officials praised sarai\\'s beauty to pharaoh, and they took her into the palace and gave abram goods in exchange. god afflicted pharaoh and his household with plagues, which led pharaoh to try to find out what was wrong.[genesis 12:14–17] upon discovering that sarai was a married woman, pharaoh demanded that abram and sarai leave.[genesis 12:18–20]\\n\\n\\n=== abram and lot separate ===\\n\\nwhen they came back to the bethel and hai area, abram\\'s and lot\\'s sizable herds occupied the same pastures. this became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family\\'s cattle. the conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that abram suggested that lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict amongst brethren. lot chose to go eastward to the plain of jordan where the land was well watered everywhere as far as zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward sodom. abram went south to hebron and settled in the plain of mamre, where he built another altar to worship god.\\n\\n\\n=== chedorlaomer ===\\n\\nduring the rebellion of the jordan river cities against elam,[genesis 14:1–9] abram\\'s nephew, lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading elamite forces. the elamite army came to collect the spoils of war, after having just defeated the king of sodom\\'s armies.[genesis 14:8–12] lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the kingdom of sodom which made them a visible target.[genesis 13:12]one person who escaped capture came and told abram what happened. once abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. abram\\'s force headed north in pursuit of the elamite army, who were already worn down from the battle of siddim. when they caught up with them at dan, abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. not only were they able to free the captives, abram\\'s unit chased and slaughtered the elamite king chedorlaomer at hobah, just north of damascus. they freed lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from sodom that had been taken.[genesis 14:13–16]upon abram\\'s return, sodom\\'s king came out to meet with him in the valley of shaveh, the \"king\\'s dale\". also, melchizedek king of salem (jerusalem), a priest of god most high, brought out bread and wine and blessed abram and god. abram then gave melchizedek a tenth of everything. the king of sodom then offered to let abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. abram refused any deal from the king of sodom, other than the share to which his allies were entitled.[genesis 14:17–24]\\n\\n\\n=== covenant of the pieces ===\\n\\nthe voice of the lord came to abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars. abram and god made a covenant ceremony, and god told of the future bondage of israel in egypt. god described to abram the land that his offspring would claim: the land of the kenites, kenizzites, kadmonites, hittites, perizzites, rephaims, amorites, canaanites, girgashites, and jebusites.[genesis 15:1–21]\\n\\n\\n=== hagar ===\\n\\nabram and sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations, because after 10 years of living in canaan, no child had been born. sarai then offered her egyptian handmaiden, hagar, to abram with the intention that she would bear him a son.\\nafter hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, sarai. sarai responded by mistreating hagar, and hagar fled into the wilderness. an angel spoke with hagar at the fountain on the way to shur. he instructed her to return to the camp of abram, and that her son would be \"a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man\\'s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.\" she was told to call her son ishmael. hagar then called god who spoke to her \"el-roi\", (\"thou god seest me:\" kjv). from that day onward, the well was called beer-lahai-roi, (\"the well of him that liveth and seeth me.\" kjv margin). she then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child. abram was 86 years of age when ishmael was born.[genesis 16:4–16]\\n\\n\\n=== sarah ===\\nthirteen years later, when abram was 99 years of age, god declared abram\\'s new name: \"abraham\" – \"a father of many nations\".[genesis 17:5] abraham then received the instructions for the covenant, of which circumcision was to be the sign.[genesis 17:10–14]god declared sarai\\'s new name: \"sarah\", blessed her, and told abraham, \"i will give thee a son also of her\".[genesis 17:15–16] abraham laughed, and \"said in his heart, \\'shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?\\'\"[genesis 17:17] immediately after abraham\\'s encounter with god, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and ishmael (age 13), circumcised.[genesis 17:22–27]\\n\\n\\n=== three visitors ===\\n\\nnot long afterward, during the heat of the day, abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the terebinths of mamre. he looked up and saw three men in the presence of god. then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. abraham rushed to sarah\\'s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. when all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.[genesis 18:1–8]one of the visitors told abraham that upon his return next year, sarah would have a son. while at the tent entrance, sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. the visitor inquired of abraham why sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for god. frightened, sarah denied laughing.\\n\\n\\n=== abraham\\'s plea ===\\n\\nafter eating, abraham and the three visitors got up. they walked over to the peak that overlooked the \\'cities of the plain\\' to discuss the fate of sodom and gomorrah for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved god to action. because abraham\\'s nephew was living in sodom, god revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. at this point, the two other visitors left for sodom. then abraham turned to god and pleaded decrementally with him (from fifty persons to less) that \"if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not god spare the city?\" for the sake of ten righteous people, god declared that he would not destroy the city.[genesis 18:17–33]when the two visitors got to sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. however, abraham\\'s nephew, lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two \"men\" stay at his house for the night. a rally of men stood outside of lot\\'s home and demanded that lot bring out his guests so that they may \"know\" (v.5) them. however, lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not \"known\" (v.8) man to the rally of men instead. they rejected that notion and sought to break down lot\\'s door to get to his male guests,[genesis 19:1–9] thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.[genesis 19:12–13]early the next morning, abraham went to the place where he stood before god. he \"looked out toward sodom and gomorrah\" and saw what became of the cities of the plain, where not even \"ten righteous\" (v.18:32) had been found, as \"the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\"[genesis 19:27–29]\\n\\n\\n=== abimelech ===\\n\\nabraham settled between kadesh and shur in the land of the philistines. while he was living in gerar, abraham openly claimed that sarah was his sister. upon discovering this news, king abimelech had her brought to him. god then came to abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man\\'s wife. abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since abraham had claimed that he and sarah were siblings. in response, god told abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. however, should he not return the wife of abraham back to him, god would surely destroy abimelech and his entire household. abimelech was informed that abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.[genesis 20:1–7]early next morning, abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of god in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. then abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: \"and yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\"[genesis 20:12] abimelech returned sarah to abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in abimelech\\'s lands. further, abimelech gave abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as sarah\\'s vindication before all. abraham then prayed for abimelech and his household, since god had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of sarah.[genesis 20:8–18]after living for some time in the land of the philistines, abimelech and phicol, the chief of his troops, approached abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. abraham then reproached abimelech due to his philistine servant\\'s aggressive attacks and the seizing of abraham\\'s well. abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. then abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to abimelech. further, to attest that abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave abimelech seven ewes for proof. because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: beersheba. after abimelech and phicol headed back to philistia, abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called upon \"the name of the lord, the everlasting god.\"[genesis 21:22–34]\\n\\n\\n=== isaac ===\\n\\nas had been prophesied in mamre the previous year,[genesis 17:21] sarah became pregnant and bore a son to abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. abraham was \"an hundred years old\", when his son whom he named isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old.[genesis] for sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, \"god hath made me to laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.\"[genesis] isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. during the celebration, however, sarah found ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of isaac.[genesis 21:8–13]\\n\\n\\n=== ishmael ===\\n\\nishmael was fourteen years old when abraham\\'s son isaac was born to sarah. when she found ishmael teasing isaac, sarah told abraham to send both ishmael and hagar away. she declared that ishmael would not share in isaac\\'s inheritance. abraham was greatly distressed by his wife\\'s words and sought the advice of his god. god told abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. god reassured abraham that \"in isaac shall seed be called to thee.\"[genesis 21:12] he also said that ishmael would make a nation, \"because he is thy seed\".[genesis 21:9–13]early the next morning, abraham brought hagar and ishmael out together. he gave her bread and water and sent them away. the two wandered in the wilderness of beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. in a moment of despair, she burst into tears. after god heard the boy\\'s voice, an angel of the lord confirmed to hagar that he would become a great nation, and will be \"living on his sword\". a well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. as the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of paran. eventually his mother found a wife for ishmael from her home country, the land of egypt.[genesis 21:14–21]\\n\\n\\n=== binding of isaac ===\\n\\nat some point in isaac\\'s youth, abraham was commanded by god to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of moriah. the patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that god told him of. he then commanded the servants to remain while he and isaac proceeded alone into the mount. isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. along the way, isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which abraham replied \"god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering\". just as abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by the angel of the lord, and he saw behind him a \"ram caught in a thicket by his horns\", which he sacrificed instead of his son. for his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. after this event, abraham went to beersheba.[genesis 22:1–19]\\n\\n\\n=== later years ===\\n\\nsarah died, and abraham buried her in the cave of the patriarchs (the \"cave of machpelah\"), near hebron which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from ephron the hittite.[genesis 23:1–20] after the death of sarah, abraham took another wife, a concubine named keturah, by whom he had six sons: zimran, jokshan, medan, midian, ishbak, and shuah.[genesis 25:1–6] according to the bible, reflecting the change of his name to \"abraham\" meaning \"a father of many nations\", abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the bible, among others   the israelites, ishmaelites,[genesis 25:12–18] edomites,[genesis 36:1–43]) amalekites,[genesis 36:12–16] kenizzites,[genesis 36:9–16] midianites and assyrians,[genesis 25:1–5] and through his nephew lot he was also related to the moabites and ammonites.[genesis 19:35–38] abraham lived to see his son marry rebekah, (and to see the birth of his twin grandsons jacob and esau). he died at age 175, and was buried in the cave of machpelah by his sons isaac and ishmael.[genesis 25:7–10][1 chronicles 1:32]\\n\\n\\n== historicity and origins ==\\n\\n\\n=== historicity ===\\n\\nin the early and middle 20th century, leading archaeologists such as william f. albright and biblical scholars such as albrecht alt believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the \"patriarchal age\", the 2nd millennium bce. but, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning israel\\'s past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in  thomas l. thompson\\'s the historicity of the patriarchal narratives (1974), and john van seters\\' abraham in history and tradition (1975). thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. his thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium bce, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns. van seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were iron age creations. by the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham, isaac or jacob credible historical figures.\\n\\n\\n=== origins of the narrative ===\\nabraham\\'s name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in genesis no longer understands its original meaning (probably \"father is exalted\" – the meaning offered in genesis 17:5, \"father of a multitude\", is a popular etymology). the story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory. at some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the pentateuch; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the persian period, roughly 520–320 bce. the mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown, but there are currently two important hypotheses. the first, called persian imperial authorisation, is that the post-exilic community devised the torah as a legal basis on which to function within the persian imperial system; the second is that the pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for determining who would belong to the post exilic jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay \"elders\".nevertheless, the completion of the torah and its elevation to the centre of post-exilic judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final pentateuch was based on existing traditions. in ezekiel 33:24, written during the exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century bce), ezekiel, an exile in babylon, tells how those who remained in judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe torah. isaiah 63:16 similarly testifies of tension between the people of judah and the returning post-exilic jews (the \"gôlâ\"), stating that god is the father of israel and that israel\\'s history begins with the exodus and not with abraham. the conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., ezra–nehemiah), is that the figure of abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of judah at the time of the exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.\\n\\n\\n== religious traditions ==\\n\\n\\n=== overview ===\\nabraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths, judaism, christianity and islam. in judaism he is the founding father of the covenant, the special relationship between the jewish people and god – leading to the belief that the jews are the chosen people of god. in christianity, the apostle paul taught that abraham\\'s faith in god – preceding the mosaic law – made him the prototype of all believers, circumcised and uncircumcised.  in islam, the prophet muhammad claimed abraham, whose submission to god constituted islam, was a \"believer before the fact\" and undercut jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with god and the covenant.\\n\\n\\n=== judaism ===\\nin jewish tradition, abraham is called avraham avinu (אברהם אבינו), \"our father abraham,\" signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the jews and the father of judaism, the first jew. his story is read in the weekly torah reading portions, predominantly in the parashot: lech-lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ), vayeira (וַיֵּרָא), chayei sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת).\\nin jewish legend, god created heaven and earth for the sake of the merits of abraham. after the deluge, abraham was the only one among the pious who solemnly swear never forsaking god, and studied in house of noah and shem to learn about \"ways of god,\" and continuing the line of high priest from noah and shem, then he descended the office to levi and his seed forever. before leaving his fathers\\' land, abraham was miraculously saved from the fiery furnace of nimrod following his brave action of breaking the idols of the chaldeans into pieces. during his sojourning in canaan, abraham was accustomed to extend hospitality to travelers and strangers and taught how to praise god also knowledge of god to those who had received his kindness.besides isaac and jacob, he is the one whose name would appear united with god, as god in judaism was called elohei abraham, elohei yitzchaq ve elohei ya`aqob (\"god of abraham, god of isaac, and god of jacob\") and never the god of any one else. he was also mentioned as the father of thirty nations.abraham is generally credited as the author of the sefer yetzirah (the book of creation), one of the earliest extant books on jewish mysticism.\\n\\n\\n=== christianity ===\\nabraham does not loom so large in christianity as he does in judaism and islam. it is jesus as the jewish messiah who is central to christianity, and the idea of a divine messiah is what separates christianity from the other two religions. in romans 4, abraham\\'s merit is less his obedience to the divine will than his faith in god\\'s ultimate grace; this faith provides him the merit for god having chosen him for the covenant, and the covenant becomes one of faith, not obedience.the roman catholic church calls abraham \"our father in faith\" in the eucharistic prayer of the roman canon, recited during the mass (see abraham in the catholic liturgy). he is also commemorated in the calendars of saints of several denominations: on 20 august by the maronite church, 28 august in the coptic church and the assyrian church of the east (with the full office for the latter), and on 9 october by the roman catholic church and the lutheran church–missouri synod. in the introduction to his 15th-century translation of the golden legend\\'s account of abraham, william caxton noted that this patriarch\\'s life was read in church on quinquagesima sunday.\\nhe is the patron saint of those in the hospitality industry. the eastern orthodox church commemorates him as the \"righteous forefather abraham\", with two feast days in its liturgical calendar. the first time is on 9 october (for those churches which follow the traditional julian calendar, 9 october falls on 22 october of the modern gregorian calendar), where he is commemorated together with his nephew \"righteous lot\". the other is on the \"sunday of the forefathers\" (two sundays before christmas), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of jesus. abraham is also mentioned in the divine liturgy of saint basil the great, just before the anaphora, and abraham and sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple.\\n\\n\\n=== islam ===\\n\\nislam regards abraham as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with adam and culminates in muhammad.ibrāhīm is mentioned in 35 chapters of the quran, more often than any other biblical personage apart from moses. he is called both a hanif (monotheist) and muslim (one who submits), and muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch, the archetype of the perfect muslim, and the revered reformer of the kaaba in mecca. islamic traditions consider ibrāhīm (abraham) the first pioneer of islam (which is also called millat ibrahim, the \"religion of abraham\"), and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the oneness of god. in islam, abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as \"ibrahim khalilullah\", meaning \"abraham the beloved of allah\".\\nbesides ishaq and yaqub, ibrahim is among the most honorable and the most excellent men in sight of god. ibrahim was also mentioned in quran as \"father of muslims\" and the role model for the community.\\n\\n\\n== in the arts ==\\n\\n\\n=== painting and sculpture ===\\npaintings on the life of abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: the sacrifice of isaac; meeting melchizedek; entertaining the three angels; hagar in the desert; and a few others. additionally, martin o\\'kane, a professor of biblical studies, writes that the parable of lazarus resting in the \"bosom of abraham\", as described in the gospel of luke, became an iconic image in christian works. according to o\\'kane, artists often chose to divert from the common literary portrayal of lazarus sitting next to abraham at a banquet in heaven and instead focus on the \"somewhat incongruous notion of abraham, the most venerated of patriarchs, holding a naked and vulnerable child in his bosom\". several artists have been inspired by the life of abraham, including albrecht dürer (1471–1528), caravaggio (1573–1610), donatello, raphael, philip van dyck (dutch painter, 1680–1753), and claude lorrain (french painter, 1600–1682). rembrandt (dutch, 1606–1669) created at least seven works on abraham, peter paul rubens (1577–1640) did several, marc chagall did at least five on abraham, gustave doré (french illustrator, 1832–1883) did six, and james tissot (french painter and illustrator, 1836–1902) did over twenty works on the subject.\\n\\nthe sarcophagus of junius bassus depicts a set of biblical stories, including abraham about to sacrifice isaac. these sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble early christian sarcophagus used for the burial of junius bassus. he died in 359. this sarcophagus has been described as \"probably the single most famous piece of early christian relief sculpture.\" the sarcophagus was originally placed in or under old st. peter\\'s basilica, was rediscovered in 1597, and is now below the modern basilica in the museo storico del tesoro della basilica di san pietro (museum of st. peter\\'s basilica) in the vatican. the base is approximately 4 × 8 × 4 feet. the old testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of christ\\'s sacrifice in the new testament, in an early form of typology. just to the right of the middle is daniel in the lion\\'s den and on the left is abraham about to sacrifice isaac.\\ngeorge segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work abraham\\'s farewell to ishmael. the human condition was central to his concerns, and segal used the old testament as a source for his imagery. this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by abraham when sarah demanded that he expel hagar and ishmael. in the sculpture, the father\\'s tenderness, sarah\\'s rage, and hagar\\'s resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. the sculpture was donated to the miami art museum after the artist\\'s death in 2000.\\n\\n\\n==== christian iconography ====\\nusually abraham can be identified by the context of the image –  the meeting with melchizedek, the three visitors, or the sacrifice of isaac. in solo portraits a sword or knife may be used as his attribute, as in this statue by gian maria morlaiter or this painting by lorenzo monaco. he always wears a gray or white beard.\\nas early as the beginning of the 3rd century, christian art followed christian typology in making the sacrifice of isaac a foreshadowing of christ\\'s sacrifice on the cross and its memorial in the sacrifice of the mass. see for example this 11th-century christian altar engraved with abraham\\'s and other sacrifices taken to prefigure that of christ in the eucharist.some early christian writers interpreted the three visitors as the triune god. thus in santa maria maggiore, rome, a 5th-century mosaic portrays only the visitors against a gold ground and puts semitransparent copies of them in the \"heavenly\" space above the scene. in eastern orthodox art the visit is the chief means by which the trinity is pictured (example). some images do not include abraham and sarah, like andrei rublev\\'s trinity, which shows only the three visitors as beardless youths at a table.\\n\\n\\n=== literature ===\\nfear and trembling (original danish title: frygt og bæven) is an influential philosophical work by søren kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym johannes de silentio (john the silent). kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in abraham when god asked him to sacrifice his son. w. g. hardy\\'s novel father abraham (1935), tells the fictionalized life of abraham.\\n\\n\\n=== music ===\\nin 1681, marc-antoine charpentier released a dramatic motet sacrificim abrahae h 402 - 402 a - 402 b, for soloists, chorus, doubling instruments and bc. sébastien de brossard released a cantate abraham (date unknown).\\nin 1994, steve reich released an opera named the cave. the title refers to the  cave of the patriarchs. the narrative of the opera is based on the story of abraham and his immediate family as it is recounted in the various religious texts, and as it is understood by individual people from different cultures and religious traditions.\\nbob dylan\\'s \"highway 61 revisited\" is the title track for his 1965 album highway 61 revisited. in 2004, rolling stone magazine ranked the song as number 364 in their 500 greatest songs of all time. the song has five stanzas. in each stanza, someone describes an unusual problem that is ultimately resolved on highway 61. in stanza 1, god tells abraham to \"kill me a son\". god wants the killing done on highway 61. abram, the original name of the biblical abraham, is also the name of dylan\\'s own father.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\nabraham path\\nabraham\\'s gate at tel dan\\napocalypse of

              " 'abraham lincoln (; february 12, 1809 – april 15, 1865) was an american statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the united states from march 1861 until his assassination in april 1865. lincoln led the nation through the american civil war, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. he preserved the union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the u.s. economy.\\nborn in a log cabin, lincoln grew up on the frontier (mainly in spencer county, indiana) in a poor family. self-educated, he became a lawyer, whig party leader, illinois state legislator, and u.s. congressman from illinois. in 1849, he left the government to resume his law practice but angered by the kansas–nebraska act\\'s opening of the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. he became a leader in the new republican party and gained national attention in the 1858 debates against national democratic leader stephen douglas in the u.s senate campaign in illinois. he then ran for president in 1860, sweeping the north and winning. southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the north was rejecting the constitutional rights of southern states to practice slavery. they began the process of seceding from the union. to secure its independence, the new confederate states of america fired on fort sumter, one of the few u.s. forts in the south. lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.\\nas the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party, lincoln confronted radical republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the south; war democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war democrats (called copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the american people. his gettysburg address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. he suspended habeas corpus, and he averted british intervention by defusing the trent affair. lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the south\\'s trade. as the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the emancipation proclamation of 1863; ordering the army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.\\nlincoln managed his own re-election campaign. he sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. a few days after the battle of appomattox court house, he was shot by john wilkes booth, an actor and confederate sympathizer, on april 14, 1865, and died the following day. abraham lincoln is remembered as the united states\\' martyr hero. he is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as the greatest u.s. president in history.\\n\\n\\n== family and childhood ==\\n\\n\\n=== early life ===\\n\\nabraham lincoln was born on february 12, 1809, as the second child of thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln, in a one-room log cabin on sinking spring farm near hodgenville, kentucky. he was a descendant of samuel lincoln, an englishman who migrated from hingham, norfolk, to its namesake, hingham, massachusetts, in 1638. samuel\\'s grandson and great-grandson began the family\\'s westward migration, passing through new jersey, pennsylvania, and virginia. lincoln\\'s paternal grandfather and namesake, captain abraham lincoln, moved the family from virginia to jefferson county, kentucky, in the 1780s. captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 1786. his children, including eight-year-old thomas, abraham\\'s father, witnessed the attack. thomas then worked at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee, before settling with members of his family in hardin county, kentucky, in the early 1800s.\\n\\nlincoln\\'s mother, nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of lucy hanks, although no record documents this. thomas and nancy married on june 12, 1806, in washington county, and moved to elizabethtown, kentucky. they produced three children: sarah, born on february 10, 1807; abraham, on february 12, 1809; and thomas, who died in infancy.thomas lincoln bought or leased farms in kentucky before becoming embroiled in legal disputes and losing all but 200 acres (81 ha) of his land in court disputes over property titles. in 1816, the family moved to indiana, where the survey process was more reliable and land titles were more secure. indiana was a \"free\" (non-slaveholding) territory, and they settled in an \"unbroken forest\" in hurricane township, perry county, indiana. (their land eventually became part of spencer county, indiana, when the county was established in 1818.) in 1860, lincoln noted that the family\\'s move to indiana was \"partly on account of slavery\", but mainly due to land title difficulties.in kentucky and indiana, thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. he owned farms, town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. thomas and nancy were members of a separate baptists church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.overcoming financial challenges, thomas eventually obtained clear title to 80 acres (32 ha) of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community.\\n\\n\\n=== mother\\'s death ===\\non october 5, 1818, nancy lincoln died of milk sickness, leaving 11-year-old sarah in charge of a household that included her father, 9-year-old abraham, and dennis hanks, nancy\\'s 19-year-old orphaned cousin. ten years later, on january 20, 1828, sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son. lincoln was very distraught over his sister\\'s death.on december 2, 1819, thomas married sarah \"sally\" bush johnston, a widow from elizabethtown, kentucky, with three children of her own. abraham became close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as \"mother\". lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. he was called lazy for all his \"reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing poetry, etc.\". his stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy \"physical labor\", but loved to read.\\n\\n\\n=== education ===\\nlincoln was largely self-educated. his formal schooling (from travelling teachers) was intermittent, totaling less than 12 months; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that he read and reread the king james bible, aesop\\'s fables, john bunyan\\'s the pilgrim\\'s progress, daniel defoe\\'s robinson crusoe, mason locke weems\\'s the life of washington, and the autobiography of benjamin franklin, among others.teenaged lincoln took responsibility for chores. he accepted the customary practice that a son give his father all earnings from work outside the home until age 21. lincoln became adept at using an axe. tall for his age, lincoln was strong and athletic. he became known for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as \"the clary\\'s grove boys\".\\n\\n\\n=== illinois ===\\nin early march 1830, partly out of fear of another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended lincoln family moved west to illinois, a free state, and settled in macon county, 10 miles (16 km) west of decatur. historians disagree on who initiated the move; thomas lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. one possibility is that other members of the family, including dennis hanks, may not have matched thomas\\'s stability and steady income.after the family relocated to illinois, abraham became increasingly distant from thomas, in part because of his father\\'s lack of education, although occasionally lending him money. in 1831, as thomas and other family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county, illinois, abraham left home. he lived in new salem for six years. lincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to new orleans, where he witnessed slavery firsthand.\\n\\n\\n=== marriage and children ===\\n\\naccording to some sources, lincoln\\'s first romantic interest was ann rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to new salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. she died on august 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever. in the early 1830s, he met mary owens from kentucky.late in 1836, lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem. owens arrived in november 1836, and lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. on august 16, 1837, lincoln wrote owens a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. she never replied.in 1840, lincoln became engaged to mary todd, a daughter of robert smith todd, a wealthy slave-owner in lexington, kentucky. they met in springfield, illinois in december 1839 and were engaged a year later. a wedding set for january 1, 1841, was canceled at lincoln\\'s initiative. they reconciled and married on november 4, 1842, in the springfield mansion of mary\\'s married sister. while anxiously preparing for the nuptials, lincoln was asked where he was going and replied, \"to hell, i suppose.\" in 1844, the couple bought a house in springfield near lincoln\\'s law office. mary kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant.he was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children. robert todd lincoln was born in 1843 and edward baker lincoln (eddie) in 1846. edward died on february 1, 1850, in springfield, probably of tuberculosis. \"willie\" lincoln was born on december 21, 1850, and died of a fever on february 20, 1862. the lincolns\\' fourth son, thomas \"tad\" lincoln, was born on april 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on july 16, 1871. robert reached adulthood and produced children. the lincolns\\' last descendant, great-grandson robert todd lincoln beckwith, died in 1985. lincoln \"was remarkably fond of children\", and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own. in fact, lincoln\\'s law partner william h. herndon would grow irritated when lincoln would bring his children to the law office. their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his own work to notice his children\\'s behaviour. herndon recounted, \"i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut. lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.\"the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. abraham suffered from \"melancholy\", a condition later referred to as clinical depression. later in life, mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and robert committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.lincoln\\'s father-in-law and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. lincoln was close to the todds, and he and his family occasionally visited them.mary cooked for lincoln often during his presidency. raised by a wealthy family, her cooking was simple, but satisfied lincoln\\'s tastes, which included imported oysters.\\n\\n\\n== early career and militia service ==\\n\\nin 1832, lincoln and partner denton offutt bought a general store on credit in new salem, illinois. although the economy was booming, the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share. that march he entered politics, running for the illinois general assembly, advocating navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he could draw crowds as a raconteur, but he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money and lost the election.lincoln interrupted his campaign to briefly serve as a captain in the illinois militia (during the black hawk war). he then returned to his campaign. at his first speech, he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his \"neck and the seat of his trousers\" and tossed him. lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct.lincoln served as new salem\\'s postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. he decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone\\'s commentaries on the laws of england and other law books. of his learning method, lincoln stated: \"i studied with nobody\".\\n\\n\\n== illinois state legislature ==\\n\\nhis second state legislature campaign in 1834 was successful. although he ran as a whig, many democrats favored him over a more powerful whig opponent. lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a whig from sangamon county. he supported the construction of the illinois and michigan canal, later serving as a canal commissioner. in the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males. he was known for his \"free soil\" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism. he first articulated this in 1837, saying, \"[the] institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\" he followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of advocating abolition and helping freed slaves to settle in liberia.admitted to the illinois bar in 1836, he moved to springfield, illinois, and began to practice law under john t. stuart, mary todd\\'s cousin. lincoln developed a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. he partnered with stephen t. logan from 1841 until 1844. then lincoln began his practice with william herndon, whom lincoln thought \"a studious young man\".\\n\\n\\n== u.s. house of representatives, 1847–1849 ==\\n\\nfrom the early 1830s, lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line whig, a disciple of henry clay\". the party, including lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization.lincoln ran for the whig nomination for illinois\\'s 7th district of the u.s. house of representatives in 1843, but was defeated by john j. hardin. however, lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby hardin would retire after only one term. lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. lincoln was indeed elected to the house of representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. he was the only whig in the illinois delegation, showing party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r. giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters.\\n\\n\\n=== committee assignments ===\\ncommittee on post office and post roads\\ncommittee on expenditures in the war department\\n\\n\\n=== political views ===\\non foreign and military policy, lincoln spoke out against the mexican–american war, which he attributed to president james k. polk\\'s desire for \"military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\". lincoln supported the wilmot proviso, which if passed would have banned slavery in any u.s. territory won from mexico.lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions. the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico, and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had \"invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil\". lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil.congress neither debated nor enacted the resolution, the national papers ignored it, and it cost lincoln political support in his district. one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him \"spotty lincoln\". lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency, lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house, supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election. taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office, but lost out. the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory. this distant territory was a democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.\\n\\n\\n== prairie lawyer ==\\n\\nlincoln practiced law in springfield, handling \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\". twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation\\'s western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. as a riverboat man, lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. in 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. the idea was never commercialized, but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.in 1851, he represented the alton & sangamon railroad in a dispute with shareholder james a. barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand barret\\'s payment. the decision by the illinois supreme court was cited by many other courts. lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. from 1853 to 1860, another of lincoln\\'s largest clients was the illinois central railroad. lincoln\\'s legal reputation gave rise to his nickname \"honest abe\".lincoln\\'s most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william \"duff\" armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker. the case is famous for lincoln\\'s use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, lincoln produced a farmers\\' almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. armstrong was acquitted.lincoln rarely raised objections; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, peachy harrison, who was accused of killing a man, lincoln angrily protested the judge\\'s decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison.\\n\\n\\n== republican politics 1854–1860 ==\\n\\n\\n=== emergence as republican leader ===\\n\\nthe debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding south and the free north. the compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue. in the early 1850s, lincoln supported sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for clay focused on the latter\\'s support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue. as the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the nebraska territory and kansas territory became particularly acrimonious, and senator douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure; the proposal would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. the proposal alarmed many northerners, who hoped to prevent the spread of slavery into the territories. despite this northern opposition, douglas\\'s kansas–nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854.for months after its passage, lincoln did not publicly comment, but he came to strongly oppose it. on october 16, 1854, in his \"peoria speech\", lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. speaking in his kentucky accent, with a powerful voice, he said the kansas act had a \"declared indifference, but as i must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. i cannot but hate it. i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ...\" lincoln\\'s attacks on the kansas–nebraska act marked his return to political life.nationally, the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas–nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. reflecting the demise of his party, lincoln wrote in 1855, \"i think i am a whig, but others say there are no whigs, and that i am an abolitionist [...] i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery.\" drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party, and combining free soil, liberty, and antislavery democratic party members, the new republican party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. lincoln resisted early recruiting attempts, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. lincoln hoped to rejuvenate the whigs, though he lamented his party\\'s growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement.in the 1854 elections, lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. in the elections\\' aftermath, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansas–nebraska act, lincoln instead sought election to the united states senate. at that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. after leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull. trumbull was an antislavery democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery democrats, had vowed not to support any whig. lincoln\\'s decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull\\'s antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate, joel aldrich matteson.\\n\\n\\n==== 1856 campaign ====\\nin part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in kansas, opposition to the kansas–nebraska act remained strong throughout the north. as the 1856 elections approached, lincoln joined the republicans. he attended the may 1856 bloomington convention, which formally established the illinois republican party. the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state. lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union. at the june 1856 republican national convention, lincoln received significant support to run for vice president, though the party nominated william dayton to run with john c. frémont. lincoln supported the republican ticket, campaigning throughout illinois. the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan, who had been out of the country serving as the u.s. representative to britain since 1853 and thus had avoided the slavery debate, while the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore. buchanan defeated both his challengers. republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois. lincoln\\'s vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois.\\n\\n\\n==== principles ====\\n\\neric foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the declaration of independence.\\n\\n\\n==== dred scott ====\\nin march 1857, in dred scott v. sandford, supreme court chief justice roger b. taney wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution. while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the north. lincoln denounced it, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power. lincoln argued, \"the authors of the declaration of independence never intended \\'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity\\', but they \\'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n=== lincoln–douglas debates and cooper union speech ===\\n\\ndouglas was up for re-election in 1858, and lincoln hoped to defeat him. with the former democrat trumbull now serving as a republican senator, many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858, and lincoln\\'s 1856 campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor. some eastern republicans favored douglas\\'s re-election in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution, which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference. for the first time, illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate, and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.\\n\\naccepting the nomination, lincoln delivered his house divided speech, drawing on mark 3:25, \"a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved—i do not expect the house to fall—but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing, or all the other.\" the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion. the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would, in turn, select lincoln or douglas. when informed of lincoln\\'s nomination, douglas stated, \"[lincoln] is the strong man of the party ... and if i beat him, my victory will be hardly won.\"the senate campaign featured seven debates, the most famous political debates in american history. the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. lincoln warned that \"the slave power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal, while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. lincoln\\'s argument was rooted in morality. he claimed that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. douglas\\'s argument was legal, claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court and the dred scott decision.\\n\\nthough the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected douglas. lincoln\\'s articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence. in may 1859, lincoln purchased the illinois staats-anzeiger, a german-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state\\'s 130,000 german americans voted democratic but the german-language paper mobilized republican support. in the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate, rivaled by william h. seward, salmon p. chase, edward bates, and simon cameron. while lincoln was popular in the midwest, he lacked support in the northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office. in january 1860, lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.on february 27, 1860, new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans. lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. lincoln insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any \"groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong\". despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. journalist noah brooks reported, \"no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience.\"historian david herbert donald described the speech as a \"superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival\\'s (seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival\\'s (chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery\". in response to an inquiry about his ambitions, lincoln said, \"the taste is in my mouth a little.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1860 presidential election ===\\n\\non may 9–10, 1860, the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. lincoln\\'s followers organized a campaign team led by david davis, norman judd, leonard swett, and jesse dubois, and lincoln received his first endorsement. exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), lincoln\\'s supporters adopted the label of \"the rail candidate\". in 1860, lincoln described himself: \"i am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\"on may 18, at the republican national convention in chicago, lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as seward and chase. a former democrat, hannibal hamlin of maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. lincoln\\'s success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the tariff.pennsylvania put him over the top, led by pennsylvania iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. lincoln\\'s managers had focused on this delegation, while following lincoln\\'s dictate to \"make no contracts that bind me\".most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party, as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. throughout the 1850s, lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats. delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention, disagreeing with douglas\\'s position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent vice president john c. breckinridge as their candidate. a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee. lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north, while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south.lincoln\\'s campaign team carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate. michael martinez wrote:\\n\\nlincoln and his political advisers manipulated his image and background....sometimes he appeared as a straight-shooting, plain-talking, common-sense-wielding man of the people. his image as the \"rail splitter\" dates from this era. his supporters also portrayed him as \"honest abe,\" the country fellow who was simply dressed and not especially polished or formal in his manner but who was as honest and trustworthy as his legs were long. even lincoln\\'s tall, gangly frame was used to good advantage during the campaign as many drawings and posters show the candidates sprinting past his vertically challenged rivals. at other times, lincoln appeared as a sophisticated, thoughtful, articulate, \"presidential\" candidate.\\n\\nprior to the republican convention, the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the wide awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. lincoln\\'s ideas of abolishing slavery grew, drawing more supporters. people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln.as douglas and the other candidates campaigned, lincoln was the only one to give no speeches. instead, he relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party. the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. thousands of republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on lincoln\\'s life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of \"free labor\", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. the republican party\\'s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln\\'s life, and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.\\n\\non november 6, lincoln was elected the 16th president of the united states. he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states. lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race. he won the free northern states, as well as california and oregon.lincoln\\'s victory in the electoral college was decisive: lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123.\\n\\n\\n== presidency ==\\n\\n\\n=== secession and inauguration ===\\n\\nafter the november election, secessionists planned to leave the union before he took office in march. on december 20, 1860, south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by february 1, 1861, florida, mississippi, alabama, georgia, louisiana, and texas had followed. six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the confederate states of america and adopted a constitution. the upper south and border states (delaware, maryland, virginia, north carolina, tennessee, kentucky, missouri, and arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. president buchanan and president-elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy, declaring secession illegal. the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9, 1861.attempts at compromise followed. lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the party\\'s free-soil in the territories platform. lincoln rejected the idea, saying, \"i will suffer death before i consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.\"lincoln did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution, which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed. a few weeks before the war, lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution. lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution.\\n\\nen route to his inauguration, lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north. the president-elect evaded possible assassins in baltimore. on february 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in washington, d.c., which was placed under substantial military guard. lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the southern states:\\n\\napprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that \"i have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. i believe i have no lawful right to do so, and i have no inclination to do so.\"\\n\\nlincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south, stating \"one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. this is the only substantial dispute.\" the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south: \"we are not enemies, but friends. we must not be enemies ... the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. by march 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms. meanwhile, lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated. lincoln said in his second inaugural address:\\n\\nboth parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\\n\\n\\n=== the civil war ===\\n\\nfort sumter\\'s commander, major robert anderson, sent a request for provisions to washington, and the execution of lincoln\\'s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. on april 12, 1861, confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight. historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south, and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion.william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was \"sadly disappointed\" at his failure to realize that \"the country was sleeping on a volcano\" and that the south was preparing for war. donald concludes that, \"his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft. sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. but he also vowed not to surrender the forts. the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.\"on april 15, lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect washington, and \"preserve the union\", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. this call forced states to choose sides. virginia seceded and was rewarded with the confederate capital, despite the exposed position of richmond close to union lines. north carolina, tennessee, and arkansas followed over the following two months. secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland, but did not prevail; kentucky remained neutral. the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason-dixon line to defend the nation.\\nstates sent union regiments south. on april 19, mobs in baltimore, which controlled rail links, attacked union troops who were changing trains. local leaders\\' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. the army responded by arresting local maryland officials. lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington. john merryman, a maryland official involved in hindering the u.s. troop movements, petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander, roger b. taney, author of the dred scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus. in june taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ. lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling.\\n\\n\\n==== union military strategy ====\\nafter the battle of fort sumter, lincoln took executive control of the war and formed an overall union military strategy. lincoln responded to this unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. he expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers. lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions. in addition, lincoln had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.\\n\\nthe war dominated lincoln\\'s time and attention. from the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success, and that any compromise would alienate factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions. copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. on august 6, 1861, lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates. in practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery.in late august 1861, general john c. frémont, the 1856 republican presidential nominee, without consulting his superiors in washington, proclaimed a very harsh martial law in missouri. lincoln cancelled the proclamation, saying its emancipation plan was political, lacking military necessity and a legal basis. after lincoln acted, union enlistments from maryland, kentucky, and missouri increased by over 40,000.in foreign policy, lincoln\\'s main goal was to stop military aid to the confederacy. lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state, william seward. at times seward was too bellicose, so for balance lincoln maintained a close working relationship with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner. the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain. the u.s. navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship, the trent, on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys; britain protested vehemently while the u.s. cheered. lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. biographer james g. randall dissected lincoln\\'s successful techniques:\\nhis restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of state department\\'s attitude toward britain, his deference toward seward and sumner, his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for america\\'s true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.\\n\\nlincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into war department. he tracked all phases of the effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their success (as well as their state and party). in january 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department, lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary. stanton centralized the war department\\'s activities, auditing and cancelling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000. stanton was a staunchly unionist, pro-business, conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction. he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official. \"stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together,\" say thomas and hyman.in terms of war strategy, lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort leading to prompt, decisive victory. however major northern newspapers demanded more—they expected victory within 90 days. twice a week, lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. occasionally mary would force him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard. lincoln learned from reading his chief of staff general henry halleck\\'s book, a disciple of the european strategist jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the mississippi river. lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy\\'s army, rather than simply capturing territory.\\n\\n\\n==== general mcclellan ====\\nafter the union rout at bull run and winfield scott\\'s retirement, lincoln appointed major general george b. mcclellan general-in-chief. mcclellan then took months to plan his peninsula campaign. mcclellan\\'s slow progress frustrated lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington. mcclellan blamed lincoln\\'s holding troops back for his campaign\\'s subsequent failure. lincoln went as far as meeting with general mcclellan in his home to discuss matters privately. once mcclellan heard lincoln was in his home, mcclellan stayed hidden away until lincoln left.\\n\\nlincoln removed mcclellan in march 1862, after mcclellan offered unsolicited political advice. in july lincoln elevated henry halleck. lincoln appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincoln\\'s desire to advance on richmond from the north, thus protecting washington from counterattack.pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862, forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington.despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan\\'s failure to reinforce pope, lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington. two days after mcclellan\\'s return to command, general robert e. lee\\'s forces crossed the potomac river into maryland, leading to the battle of antietam in september. the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history, but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january. lincoln had waited for a military victory so that the proclamation would not be perceived as the product of desperation.mcclellan then resisted the president\\'s demand that he pursue lee\\'s army, while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee. lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside. both were presumably more supportive of the commander-in-chief.burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december. desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and increased after fredericksburg. lincoln promoted joseph hooker.the midterm elections in 1862 cost the republicans severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of habeas corpus, military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market. the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest, but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest, where many southerners had lived for generations.in the spring of 1863, lincoln became optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond, rosecrans on chattanooga, grant on vicksburg, and a naval assault on charleston.hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may. he then resigned and was replaced by george meade as lee moved north. meade followed lee into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign, but then failed to follow up despite lincoln\\'s demands. at the same time, grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river, splitting off the far western rebel states.\\n\\n\\n==== emancipation proclamation ====\\n\\nthe federal government\\'s power to end slavery was limited by the constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. lincoln argued that slavery would end by preventing its expansion into new territories. he sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. lincoln believed that curtailing slavery would make it obsolete. lincoln rejected fremont\\'s two emancipation attempts in august 1861 and one by major general david hunter in may 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states.on june 19, 1862, endorsed by lincoln, congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. in july, the confiscation act of 1862 was enacted, which set up court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion. although lincoln believed this was not within congress\\'s power, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. he felt such action could be taken only by the commander-in-chief, using constitutional war powers, which he planned to do. lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet.privately, lincoln concluded that the confederacy\\'s slave base had to be eliminated. however, copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune agreed. lincoln rejected this argument directly in his letter of august 22, 1862. although he said he personally wished all men could be free, lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his \"official duty\") was that of preserving the union:\\nmy paramount object in this struggle is to save the union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it, and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it; and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that. what i do about slavery, and the colored race, i do because i believe it helps to save the union; and what i forbear, i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union ... [¶] i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and i intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.\\nthe emancipation proclamation, issued on september 22, 1862, with effect on january 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control, with exemptions specified for areas under union control in two states. lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves. lincoln\\'s comment on the signing of the proclamation was: \"i never, in my life, felt more certain that i was doing right, than i do in signing this paper.\" lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he supported this in the proclamation, but the undertaking failed.enlisting former slaves became official policy. by the spring of 1863, lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, lincoln wrote, \"the bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once\". by the end of 1863, at lincoln\\'s direction, general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley.\\n\\n\\n==== gettysburg address (1863) ====\\n\\nlincoln spoke at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19, 1863. defying his prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the address became the most quoted speech in american history.in 272 words, and three minutes, lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, \"conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\". he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".\\n\\n\\n==== general grant ====\\n\\ngrant\\'s victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln. responding to criticism of grant after shiloh, lincoln had said, \"i can\\'t spare this man. he fights.\" with grant in command, lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters, and incorporate black troops. meade\\'s failure to capture lee\\'s army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander. grant stayed with meade\\'s army and told meade what to do.lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864, as was mcclellan. lincoln arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grant\\'s political intentions. assured that he had none, lincoln submitted grant\\'s appointment to the senate. he obtained congress\\'s consent to make him lieutenant general, a rank that had remained unoccupied since george washington.grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864, with heavy losses on both sides. despite this, when lincoln asked what grant\\'s plans were, the general replied, \"i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\"grant\\'s army moved steadily south. lincoln traveled to grant\\'s headquarters at city point, virginia to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman. lincoln replaced the union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north.lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the south\\'s morale and weaken its fighting ability. lincoln emphasized defeat of the confederate armies rather than destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.in 1864 confederate general jubal early raided washington, d.c., while lincoln watched from an exposed position; captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him, \"get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\"as grant continued to attrit lee\\'s forces, efforts to discuss peace began. confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln, seward, and others at hampton roads. lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. on april 1, 1865, grant nearly encircled petersburg. the confederate government evacuated and the city fell. lincoln visited the conquered capital. on april 9, lee surrendered to grant at appomattox officially ending the war.\\n\\n\\n=== re-election ===\\n\\nlincoln ran again in 1864. he united the main republican factions, along with war democrats such as edwin m. stanton and andrew johnson. lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the radicals\\' efforts to replace him. at its convention, the republicans selected johnson as his running mate. to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans, lincoln ran under the label of the new union party.grant\\'s bloody stalemates damaged lincoln\\'s re-election prospects, and many republicans feared defeat. lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house: lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.\\nwhile the democratic platform followed the \"peace wing\" of the party and called the war a \"failure\", their candidate, mcclellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. lincoln provided grant with more troops and led his party to renew its support for grant. sherman\\'s capture of atlanta in september and david farragut\\'s capture of mobile ended defeatism. the democratic party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln. the national union party was united by lincoln\\'s support for emancipation. state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads. on november 8, lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of union soldiers.\\n\\non march 4, 1865, lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. in it, he deemed the endless casualties to be god\\'s will. historian mark noll claims this speech to rank \"among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world\". lincoln said:\\n\\nfondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. yet, if god wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man\\'s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, \"the judgments of the lord, are true and righteous altogether\". with malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as god gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation\\'s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.\\n\\n\\n=== reconstruction ===\\n\\nreconstruction began during the war, as lincoln and his associates considered how to reintegrate the nation, and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves. shortly after lee\\'s surrender, a general asked lincoln how to treat defeated confederates. lincoln replied, \"let \\'em up easy.\" lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war even when it had passed, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. his main goal was to keep the union together. he planned to go forward not by focusing on who to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the radicals, under rep. thaddeus stevens, sen. charles sumner and sen. benjamin wade, who otherwise remained lincoln\\'s allies. determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south, lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. his amnesty proclamation of december 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office, had not mistreated union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.\\n\\nas southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations re-formed. in tennessee and arkansas, lincoln appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors, respectively. in louisiana, lincoln ordered general nathaniel p. banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed. democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans\\' political aspirations. the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the wade–davis bill, in 1864, which lincoln vetoed. the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana, arkansas, and tennessee.lincoln\\'s appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals. to fill chief justice taney\\'s seat on the supreme court, he named the radicals\\' choice, salmon p. chase, who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.after implementing the emancipation proclamation, lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. he declared that such an amendment would \"clinch the whole matter\". by december 1863, an amendment was brought to congress. this first attempt failed, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on june 15, 1864, in the house of representatives. passage became part of the republican/unionist platform. after a house debate, the second attempt passed on january 31, 1865. with ratification, it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6, 1865.lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. he signed senator charles sumner\\'s freedmen\\'s bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern unionists.historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived. biographers james g. randall and richard current, according to david lincove, argue that:\\nit is likely that had he lived, lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson\\'s, that he would have clashed with congressional radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson\\'s mistakes.\\n\\neric foner argues that:\\nunlike sumner and other radicals, lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. he believed, as most republicans did in april 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former confederates. but time and again during the war, lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans. ... lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death.\\n\\n\\n=== native american policy ===\\nlincoln\\'s connection with indians was pre-dated by his grandfather, who was killed by indians in 1784. lincoln claimed indians were antagonistic toward his father, thomas lincoln, and his young family. although lincoln was a veteran of the black hawk war, fought in wisconsin and illinois, in 1832, he saw no significant action. during his presidency, lincoln\\'s policy toward indians was dominated by political considerations. lincoln used the indian bureau as a source of patronage, making  blanket appointments to his loyal followers in minnesota and wisconsin. president lincoln faced difficulties guarding western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from indian attacks.on august 17, 1862 the sioux uprising, in alliance with the yankton indians, started in minnesota, killing hundreds of white settlers, forcing 30,000 from their homes. the indian violence deeply alarmed the lincoln administration. some believed it was a conspiracy by the confederacy to launch a war on the northwestern front. taking the matter seriously, lincoln sent a senior general, john pope, to minnesota, making him commander of the new northwestern department.  lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war (pows), sent by railroad, to put down the sioux uprising. when the confederates protested turning pows into indian fighters, lincoln relented, and revoked the policy. pope campaigned against the indians mercilessly and with vigor, even advocating their extinction. pope ordered indian farms and food supplies, to be destroyed, while indian warriors to be killed. aiding pope, minnesota congressman col. henry h. sibley led militiamen and regular troops to defeat the sioux at wood lake. by october 9, pope considered the uprising to be ended, although hostilities ceased on december 26.presented with 303 execution warrants for santee dakota who were convicted of killing innocent farmers, lincoln conducted his own personal review of each warrant, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). former governor of minnesota alexander ramsey told lincoln, in 1864, that lincoln would have gotten more presidential election support had he executed all 303 of the indians. lincoln responded, \"i could not afford to hang men for votes.\"\\n\\n\\n=== other enactments ===\\nlincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency, giving congress primary responsibility for lawmaking while the executive enforced them. lincoln vetoed only four bills; the only important one was the wade-davis bill with its harsh reconstruction program. the 1862 homestead act made millions of acres of western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. the 1862 morrill land-grant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states\\' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869. the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.in july 1861, the us issued paper currency for the first time. the currency became known greenbacks, because it was printed in green on the reverse side.\\nother important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a federal income tax. in 1861, lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs, following the first enacted by buchanan. also in 1861, lincoln signed the revenue act of 1861, creating the first u.s. income tax. this created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($22,800 in current dollar terms). the revenue act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income.lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government\\'s economic influence in other areas. the national banking act created the system of national banks. it also established a national currency. in 1862, congress created the department of agriculture.in response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. lincoln attacked the media about such behavior, ordering the military to seize the two papers. the seizure lasted for two days.lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday. thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the 17th century. it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. the prior proclamation had been during james madison\\'s presidency 50 years earlier. in 1863, lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving.in june 1864, lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park.\\n\\n\\n=== judicial appointments ===\\n\\n\\n==== supreme court appointments ====\\n\\nlincoln\\'s declared philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\" lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court. noah haynes swayne was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the union. samuel freeman miller, supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. david davis was lincoln\\'s campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in lincoln\\'s illinois court circuit. democrat stephen johnson field, a previous california supreme court justice, provided geographic and political balance. finally, lincoln\\'s treasury secretary, salmon p. chase, became chief justice. lincoln believed chase was an able jurist, would support reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the republican party.\\n\\n\\n==== other judicial appointments ====\\nlincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states, and 27 judges to the united states district courts. lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office.\\n\\n\\n=== states admitted to the union ===\\nwest virginia was admitted to the union on june 20, 1863. nevada, which became the third state in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on october 31, 1864.\\n\\n\\n=== death ===\\n\\nabraham lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth on good friday, april 14, 1865, while attending a play at ford\\'s theatre, five days after lee\\'s surrender. booth was a well-known actor and a confederate spy from maryland; though he never joined the confederate army, he had contacts with the confederate secret service. after attending an april 11, 1865, speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, booth decided to assassinate the president. learning of lincoln\\'s intent to attend the play with grant, booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater and to kill vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their respective homes. lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14. at the last minute, grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, fired at the back of lincoln\\'s head, mortally wounding him. lincoln\\'s guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth, but booth stabbed him and escaped.lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house. after remaining in a coma for nine hours, lincoln died at 7:22 am on april 15. after death his face relaxed into a smile. stanton saluted and said, \"now he belongs to the ages.\"lincoln\\'s flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers, while the city\\'s church bells rang. president johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after lincoln\\'s death.\\nbooth was tracked to a farm in virginia. refusing to surrender, he was shot on april 26.\\n\\n\\n=== funeral and burial ===\\n\\nthe late president lay in state, first in the east room, and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 through april 21. the caskets containing lincoln\\'s body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train. the train followed a circuitous route from washington d.c. to springfield, illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom\\'d to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about lincoln. african-americans were especially moved; they had lost \\'their moses\\'. in a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war. historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death.\\n\\n\\n== religious and philosophical beliefs ==\\n\\nas a young man, lincoln was a religious skeptic. later in life, lincoln\\'s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical protestants. he never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. he was deeply familiar with the bible, and he both quoted and praised it. he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs. however, he did believe in an all-powerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.in the 1840s, lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. in the 1850s, lincoln asserted his belief in \"providence\" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence. with the death of his son edward, lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god. the death of son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for solace. after willie\\'s death, lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. he wrote at this time that god \"could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest. yet the contest began. and having begun, he could give the final victory to either side any day. yet the contest proceeds.\" on the day lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land.\\n\\n\\n== health ==\\n\\nseveral claims have been made that lincoln\\'s health was declining before the assassination. these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, men2b, which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma, mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid appearance. others simply claim he had marfan syndrome, based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible aortic regurgitation, which can cause bobbing of the head (demusset\\'s sign) – based on blurring of lincoln\\'s head in photographs, which required long exposure times. confirmation of this and other diseases could possibly be obtained via dna analysis of a pillow case stained with lincoln\\'s blood, currently in possession of the grand army of the republic museum & library in philadelphia, but the museum has so far refused to provide a sample for testing.\\n\\n\\n== legacy ==\\n\\nthe successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. the term \"the united states\" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (\"these united states\"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.historians such as harry jaffa, herman belz, john diggins, vernon burton, and eric foner stress lincoln\\'s redefinition of republican values. as early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the constitution, lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values—what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. the declaration\\'s emphasis on equality and freedom for all, in contrast to the constitution\\'s tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. regarding the 1860 cooper union speech, diggins notes, \"lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\" he highlights the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. nevertheless, lincoln justified the war via legalisms (the constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. burton argues that lincoln\\'s republicanism was taken up by the emancipated freedmen.in lincoln\\'s first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. he denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. he said \"a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\"\\n\\n\\n=== historical reputation ===\\nin his company, i was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color.\\n\\nin surveys of u.s. scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s, lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one. a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after george washington. in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since 1948, lincoln has been rated at the top in the majority of polls. generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. lincoln; 2. washington; and 3. franklin delano roosevelt, although the order varies.president lincoln\\'s assassination left him a national martyr. he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. republicans linked lincoln\\'s name to their party. many, though not all, in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. historians have said he was \"a classical liberal\" in the 19th century sense. allen c. guelzo states that lincoln was a\\nclassical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an american counterpart to mill, cobden, and bright (whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office).\\n\\nlincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world.schwartz argues that lincoln\\'s american reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the progressive era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of america\\'s most venerated heroes, even among white southerners. the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington, d.c. in the new deal era, liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state. in the cold war years, lincoln\\'s image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.\\n\\nby the 1970s, lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers. as a whig activist, lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to the agrarian democrats. william c. harris found that lincoln\\'s \"reverence for the founding fathers, the constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism\". james g. randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation \"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform\". randall concludes that, \"he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called \\'radicalism\\' which involved abuse of the south, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\"by the late 1960s, some african american intellectuals, led by lerone bennett jr., rejected lincoln\\'s role as the great emancipator. bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. defenders, such as authors dirck and cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln\\'s image suffered \"erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule\" in the late 20th century. on the other hand, donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were \"content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason\". in the 21st century, president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln\\'s bible for his inaugural ceremonies.lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.union nationalism, as envisioned by lincoln, \"helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt, woodrow wilson, and franklin delano roosevelt.\"\\n\\n\\n=== memory and memorials ===\\n\\nlincoln\\'s portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency, the penny and the $5 bill. his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of nebraska. while he is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old grace bedell.\\nthe most famous and most visited memorials are lincoln\\'s sculpture on mount rushmore; lincoln memorial, ford\\'s theatre, and petersen house (where he died) in washington, d.c.; and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield, illinois, not far from lincoln\\'s home, as well as his tomb.sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with \"a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life\". during the great depression, he argues, lincoln served \"as a means for seeing the world\\'s disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful\". franklin d. roosevelt, preparing america for war, used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan. americans asked, \"what would lincoln do?\" however, schwartz also finds that since world war ii, lincoln\\'s symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness\". he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.the united states navy nimitz-class aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln (cvn-72) is named after lincoln, the second navy ship to bear his name.\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\noutline of abraham lincoln\\nsexuality of abraham lincoln\\ndakota war of 1862\\ngrace bedell\\nlincoln

              " 'abstract art uses  visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. western art had been, from the renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. by the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. the sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of western culture at that time.abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are closely related terms. they are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.\\nabstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. this departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. abstraction exists along a continuum. even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. in geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. but figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contain partial abstraction.\\nboth geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract. among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.\\n\\n\\n== abstraction in early art and many cultures ==\\n\\nmuch of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose. it is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates. one can enjoy the beauty of chinese calligraphy or islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.\\n\\nin chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the tang dynasty painter wang mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style. while none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some song dynasty paintings. the chan buddhist painter liang kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his \"immortal in splashed ink\" in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. a late song painter named yu jian, adept to tiantai buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many japanese zen painters. his paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. this type of painting was continued by sesshu toyo in his later years.\\n\\nanother instance of abstraction in chinese painting is seen in zhu derun\\'s cosmic circle. on the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass) floats in the void. the painting is a reflection of the daoist metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.\\nin tokugawa japan, some zen monk-painters created enso, a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.\\n\\n\\n== 19th century ==\\n\\npatronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists. three art movements which contributed to the development of abstract art were romanticism, impressionism and expressionism. artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. an objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the paintings of john constable, j m w turner, camille corot and from them to the impressionists who continued the plein air painting of the barbizon school.\\n\\nearly intimations of a new art had been made by james mcneill whistler who, in his painting nocturne in black and gold: the falling rocket, (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.\\nexpressionist painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to impressionism and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. the expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. although artists like edvard munch and james ensor drew influences principally from the work of the post-impressionists they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.\\npaul cézanne had begun as an impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point, with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into cubism by georges braque and pablo picasso.\\nadditionally in the late 19th century in eastern europe mysticism and early modernist religious philosophy as expressed by theosophist mme. blavatsky had a profound impact on pioneer geometric artists like hilma af klint and wassily kandinsky. the mystical teaching of georges gurdjieff and p.d. ouspensky also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of piet mondrian and his colleagues in the early 20th century.\\n\\n\\n== 20th century ==\\n\\npost impressionism as practiced by paul gauguin, georges seurat, vincent van gogh and paul cézanne had an enormous impact on 20th-century art and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. the heritage of painters like van gogh, cézanne, gauguin, and seurat was essential for the development of modern art. at the beginning of the 20th century henri matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist georges braque, andré derain, raoul dufy and maurice de vlaminck revolutionized the paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called fauvism. with his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing henri matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in french window at collioure (1914), view of notre-dame (1914), and the yellow curtain from 1915. the raw language of color as developed by the fauves directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, wassily kandinsky.\\nalthough cubism ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with fauvism, the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. pablo picasso made his first cubist paintings based on cézanne\\'s idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. with the painting les demoiselles d\\'avignon (1907), picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of african tribal masks and his own new cubist inventions. analytic cubism was jointly developed by pablo picasso and georges braque, from about 1908 through 1912. analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by synthetic cubism, practiced by braque, picasso, fernand léger, juan gris, albert gleizes, marcel duchamp and others into the 1920s. synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter. the collage artists like kurt schwitters and man ray and others taking the clue from cubism were instrumental to the development of the movement called dada.\\n\\nthe italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti published the manifesto of futurism in 1909, which later inspired artists such as carlo carra in painting of sounds, noises and smells and umberto boccioni train in motion, 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with cubism, profoundly influenced art movements throughout europe.during the 1912 salon de la section d\\'or, where františek kupka exhibited the abstract painting amorpha, fugue en deux couleurs (fugue in two colors) (1912), the poet guillaume apollinaire named the work of several artists including robert delaunay, orphism. he defined it as, \"the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art.\"since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major european cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of modernism. ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist\\'s books, exhibitions and manifestos so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. the following extract from the world backwards gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: \"david burliuk\\'s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second knave of diamonds exhibition, held in january 1912 (in moscow) included not only paintings sent from munich, but some members of the german die brücke group, while from paris came work by robert delaunay, henri matisse and fernand léger, as well as picasso. during the spring david burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the knave of diamonds was to finance. he went abroad in may and came back determined to rival the almanac der blaue reiter which had emerged from the printers while he was in germany\".from 1909 to 1913 many experimental works in the search for this \\'pure art\\' had been created by a number of artists: francis picabia painted caoutchouc, c. 1909, the spring, 1912, dances at the spring and the procession, seville, 1912; wassily kandinsky painted untitled (first abstract watercolor), 1913, improvisation 21a, the impression series, and picture with a circle (1911); františek kupka had painted the orphist works, discs of newton (study for fugue in two colors), 1912 and amorpha, fugue en deux couleurs (fugue in two colors), 1912; robert delaunay painted a series entitled simultaneous windows and formes circulaires, soleil n°2 (1912–13); léopold survage created colored rhythm (study for the film), 1913; piet mondrian, painted tableau no. 1 and composition no. 11, 1913.\\n\\nand the search continued: the rayist (luchizm) drawings of natalia goncharova and mikhail larionov, used lines like rays of light to make a construction. kasimir malevich completed his first entirely abstract work, the suprematist, black square, in 1915. another of the suprematist group\\' liubov popova, created the architectonic constructions and spatial force constructions between 1916 and 1921. piet mondrian was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, neo-plasticism was the aesthetic which mondrian, theo van doesburg and other in the group de stijl intended to reshape the environment of the future.\\n\\n\\n== music ==\\nas visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. wassily kandinsky, himself an amateur musician, was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color resounding in the soul. the idea had been put forward by charles baudelaire, that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.\\nclosely related to this, is the idea that art has the spiritual dimension and can transcend \\'every-day\\' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. the theosophical society popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of india and china in the early years of the century. it was in this context that piet mondrian, wassily kandinsky, hilma af klint and other artists working towards an \\'objectless state\\' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an \\'inner\\' object.\\nthe universal and timeless shapes found in geometry: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.\\n\\n\\n== russian avant-garde ==\\n\\nmany of the abstract artists in russia became constructivists believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. the artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. art into life! was vladimir tatlin\\'s slogan, and that of all the future constructivists. varvara stepanova and alexandre exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.\\non the other side stood kazimir malevich, anton pevsner and naum gabo. they argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual\\'s place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left russia. anton pevsner went to france, gabo went first to berlin, then to england and finally to america. kandinsky studied in moscow then left for the bauhaus. by the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only socialist realism was allowed.\\n\\n\\n== the bauhaus ==\\nthe bauhaus at weimar, germany was founded in 1919 by walter gropius. the philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. this philosophy had grown from the ideas of the arts and crafts movement in england and the deutscher werkbund. among the teachers were paul klee, wassily kandinsky, johannes itten, josef albers, anni albers, and lászló moholy-nagy. in 1925 the school was moved to dessau and, as the nazi party gained control in 1932, the bauhaus was closed. in 1937 an exhibition of degenerate art, \\'entartete kunst\\' contained all types of avant-garde art disapproved of by the nazi party. then the exodus began: not just from the bauhaus but from europe in general; to paris, london and america. paul klee went to switzerland but many of the artists at the bauhaus went to america.\\n\\n\\n== abstraction in paris and london ==\\n\\nduring the 1930s paris became the host to artists from russia, germany, the netherlands and other european countries affected by the rise of totalitarianism. sophie tauber and jean arp collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. the polish katarzyna kobro applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. the many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. an exhibition by forty-six members of the cercle et carré group organized by joaquin torres-garcia assisted by michel seuphor contained work by the neo-plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as kandinsky, anton pevsner and kurt schwitters. criticized by theo van doesburg to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal art concret setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality. abstraction-création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in london. the first exhibition of british abstract art was held in england in 1935. the following year the more international abstract and concrete exhibition was organized by nicolete gray including work by piet mondrian, joan miró, barbara hepworth and ben nicholson. hepworth, nicholson and gabo moved to the st. ives group in cornwall to continue their \\'constructivist\\' work.\\n\\n\\n== america: mid-century ==\\n\\nduring the nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled europe to the united states. by the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, surrealism, and dada were represented in new york: marcel duchamp, fernand léger, piet mondrian, jacques lipchitz, andré masson, max ernst, andré breton, were just a few of the exiled europeans who arrived in new york. the rich cultural influences brought by the european artists were distilled and built upon by local new york painters. the climate of freedom in new york allowed all of these influences to flourish. the art galleries that primarily had focused on european art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger american artists who had begun to mature. certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. during this period piet mondrian\\'s painting composition no. 10, 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.\\nsome artists of the period defied categorization, such as georgia o\\'keeffe who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.\\neventually american artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. the best known group of american artists became known as the abstract expressionists and the new york school. in new york city there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. artists and teachers john d. graham and hans hofmann became important bridge figures between the newly arrived european modernists and the younger american artists coming of age. mark rothko, born in russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. the expressionistic gesture and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to jackson pollock, robert motherwell, and franz kline. while during the 1940s arshile gorky\\'s and willem de kooning\\'s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. new york city became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in america as well.\\n\\n\\n== later developments ==\\n\\ndigital art, hard-edge painting, geometric abstraction, minimalism, lyrical abstraction, op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, monochrome painting, assemblage, neo-dada, shaped canvas painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.\\nin the united states, art as object as seen in the minimalist sculpture of donald judd and the paintings of frank stella are seen today as newer permutations. other examples include lyrical abstraction and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as robert motherwell, patrick heron, kenneth noland, sam francis, cy twombly, richard diebenkorn, helen frankenthaler, joan mitchell.\\n\\n\\n== causation ==\\none socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of theodor w. adorno – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in industrial society.frederic jameson similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values. the social content of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of late modernity.post-jungians by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.\\n\\n\\n== gallery

he was certainly a major exponent of the form.while his works were freely in circulation until the early years of the twentieth century, in 1932 the first modern censored edition of his works appeared in cairo. in january 2001, the egyptian ministry of culture ordered the burning of some 6,000 copies of books of homoerotic poetry by abu nuwas. any mention of pederasty was omitted from his entry in the saudi global arabic encyclopedia.in 1976, a crater on the planet mercury was named in honor of abu nuwas.a heavily fictionalised abu nuwas is the protagonist of the novels the father of locks (dedalus books, 2009) and the khalifah\\'s mirror (2012) by andrew killeen, in which he is depicted as a spy working for ja\\'far al-barmaki.in the sudanese novel season of migration to the north (1966) by tayeb salih, abu nuwas\\'s love poetry is cited extensively by one of the novel\\'s protagonists, the sudanese mustafa sa\\'eed, as a means of seducing a young english woman in london: \"does it not please you that the earth is awaking,/ that old virgin wine is there for the taking?\"\\n\\n\\n=== baghdad ===\\nal-khatib al-baghdadi, the author of the history of baghdad, wrote that abu nuwas was buried in shunizi cemetery in baghdad.the city has several places named for the poet. abū nuwās street runs along the east bank of the tigris that was once the city’s showpiece. abu nuwas park is also located there on the 2.5-kilometer stretch between the jumhouriya bridge and a park that extends out to the river in karada near the 14th of july bridge.\\n\\n\\n== swahili culture ==\\nthe tanzanian artist godfrey mwampembwa (gado) created a swahili comic book called abunuwasi which was published in 1996. it features a trickster figure named abunuwasi as the protagonist in three stories draw inspiration from east african folklore as well as the fictional abu nuwasi of one thousand and one nights.\\n\\n\\n== notes ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\nkhallikān (ibn), aḥmad ibn muḥammad (1843). ibn khallikan\\'s biographical dictionary (tr. wafayāt al-a\\'yān wa-al-anbā abnā\\' al-zamān). i. translated by mcguckin de slane, william. london: w.h. allen. pp. 391–395.khallikān (ibn), aḥmad ibn muḥammad (1972). wafayāt al-a\\'yān wa-anbā\\' abnā\\' al-zamān (the obituaries of eminent men} (in arabic). ii. beirut: dār ṣādar. pp. 95-104 (§170 ).nadīm (al), abū al-faraj muḥammad ibn isḥāq abū ya’qūb al-warrāq (1970).  dodge, bayard (ed.). the fihrist of al-nadim;

              " 'the achaemenid empire (; 𐎧𐏁𐏂 xšāça  (old persian) \"the empire\" c. 550–330 bc), also called the first persian empire, was an ancient iranian empire based in western asia founded by cyrus the great. ranging at its greatest extent from the balkans and eastern europe proper in the west to the indus valley in the east, it was larger than any previous empire in history, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers. incorporating various peoples of different origins and faiths, it is notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through satraps under the king of kings), for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system, the use of an official language across its territories, and the development of civil services and a large professional army. the empire\\'s successes inspired similar systems in later empires.by the 7th century bc, the persians had settled in the south-western portion of the iranian plateau in the region of persis, which came to be their heartland. from this region, cyrus the great advanced to defeat the medes, lydia, and the neo-babylonian empire, establishing the achaemenid empire. alexander the great, an avid admirer of cyrus the great, conquered most of the empire by 330 bc. upon alexander\\'s death, most of the empire\\'s former territory fell under the rule of the ptolemaic kingdom and seleucid empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time. the iranian elites of the central plateau reclaimed power by the second century bc under the parthian empire.the achaemenid empire is noted in western history as the antagonist of the greek city-states during the greco-persian wars and for the emancipation of the jewish exiles in babylon. the historical mark of the empire went far beyond its territorial and military influences and included cultural, social, technological and religious influences as well. despite the lasting conflict between the two states, many athenians adopted achaemenid customs in their daily lives in a reciprocal cultural exchange, some being employed by or allied to the persian kings. the impact of cyrus\\'s edict is mentioned in judeo-christian texts, and the empire was instrumental in the spread of zoroastrianism as far east as china. the empire also set the tone for the politics, heritage and history of iran (also known as persia).\\n\\n\\n== etymology ==\\nthe term achaemenid means \"of the family of the achaemenis/achaemenes\" (old persian: 𐏃𐎧𐎠𐎶𐎴𐎡𐏁 haxāmaniš; a bahuvrihi compound translating to \"having a friend\\'s mind\"). achaemenes was himself a minor seventh-century ruler of the anshan in southwestern iran, and a vassal of assyria.\\n\\n\\n== history ==\\n\\n\\n=== achaemenid timeline ===\\nastronomical year numbering\\n\\ndates are approximate, consult particular article for details\\n\\n\\n=== origin ===\\n\\nthe persian nation contains a number of tribes as listed here. ... : the pasargadae, maraphii, and maspii, upon which all the other tribes are dependent. of these, the pasargadae are the most distinguished; they contain the clan of the achaemenids from which spring the perseid kings. other tribes are the panthialaei, derusiaei, germanii, all of which are attached to the soil, the remainder—the dai, mardi, dropici, sagarti, being nomadic.\\n\\nthe achaemenid empire was created by nomadic persians. the name \"persia\" is a greek and latin pronunciation of the native word referring to the country of the people originating from persis (old persian: 𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿, pārsa). the persians were an iranian people who arrived in what is today iran c. 1000 bc and settled a region including north-western iran, the zagros mountains and persis alongside the native elamites. for a number of centuries they fell under the domination of the neo-assyrian empire (911–609 bc), based in northern mesopotamia. the persians were originally nomadic pastoralists in the western iranian plateau and by 850 bc were calling themselves the parsa and their constantly shifting territory parsua, for the most part localized around persis. the achaemenid empire was not the first iranian empire, as the medes, another group of iranian peoples, established a short-lived empire and played a major role in the overthrow of the assyrian.the achaemenids were initially rulers of the elamite city of anshan near the modern city of marvdasht; the title \"king of anshan\" was an adaptation of the earlier elamite title \"king of susa and anshan\". there are conflicting accounts of the identities of the earliest kings of anshan. according to the cyrus cylinder (the oldest extant genealogy of the achaemenids) the kings of anshan were teispes, cyrus i, cambyses i and cyrus ii, also known as cyrus the great, who created the empire (the later behistun inscription, written by darius the great, claims that teispes was the son of achaemenes and that darius is also descended from teispes through a different line, but no earlier texts mention achaemenes). in herodotus\\' histories, he writes that cyrus the great was the son of cambyses i and mandane of media, the daughter of astyages, the king of the median empire.\\n\\n\\n=== formation and expansion ===\\n\\ncyrus revolted against the median empire in 553 bc, and in 550 bc succeeded in defeating the medes, capturing astyages and taking the median capital city of ecbatana. once in control of ecbatana, cyrus styled himself as the successor to astyages and assumed control of the entire empire. by inheriting astyages\\' empire, he also inherited the territorial conflicts the medes had had with both lydia and the neo-babylonian empire.king croesus of lydia sought to take advantage of the new international situation by advancing into what had previously been median territory in asia minor. cyrus led a counterattack which not only fought off croesus\\' armies, but also led to the capture of sardis and the fall of the lydian kingdom in 546 bc. cyrus placed pactyes in charge of collecting tribute in lydia and left, but once cyrus had left pactyes instigated a rebellion against cyrus. cyrus sent the median general mazares to deal with the rebellion, and pactyes was captured. mazares, and after his death harpagus, set about reducing all the cities which had taken part in the rebellion. the subjugation of lydia took about four years in total.when power in ecbatana changed hands from the medes to the persians, many tributaries to the median empire believed their situation had changed and revolted against cyrus. this forced cyrus to fight wars against bactria and the nomadic saka in central asia. during these wars, cyrus established several garrison towns in central asia, including the cyropolis.\\n\\nnothing is known of persian-babylonian relations between 547 bc and 539 bc, but it is likely that there were hostilities between the two empires for several years leading up to the war of 540–539 bc and the fall of babylon. in october 539 bc, cyrus won a battle against the babylonians at opis, then took sippar without a fight before finally capturing the city of babylon on 12 october, where the babylonian king nabonidus was taken prisoner. upon taking control of the city, cyrus depicted himself in propaganda as restoring the divine order which had been disrupted by nabonidus, who had promoted the cult of sin rather than marduk, and he also portrayed himself as restoring the heritage of the neo-assyrian empire by comparing himself to the assyrian king ashurbanipal. the hebrew bible also unreservedly praises cyrus for his actions in the conquest of babylon, referring to him as yahweh\\'s anointed. he is credited with freeing the people of judah from their exile and with authorizing the reconstruction of much of jerusalem, including the second temple.\\n\\nin 530 bc, cyrus died while on a military expedition against the massagetae in central asia. he was succeeded by his eldest son cambyses ii, while his younger son bardiya received a large territory in central asia. by 525 bc, cambyses had successfully subjugated phoenicia and cyprus and was making preparations to invade egypt with the newly created persian navy. the great pharaoh amasis ii had died in 526 bc and had been succeeded by psamtik iii, resulting in the defection of key egyptian allies to the persians. psamtik positioned his army at pelusium in the nile delta. he was soundly defeated by the persians in the battle of pelusium before fleeing to memphis, where the persians defeated him and took him prisoner.herodotus depicts cambyses as openly antagonistic to the egyptian people and their gods, cults, temples and priests, in particular stressing the murder of the sacred bull apis. he says that these actions led to a madness that caused him to kill his brother bardiya (who herodotus says was killed in secret), his own sister-wife and croesus of lydia. he then concludes that cambyses completely lost his mind, and all later classical authors repeat the themes of cambyses\\' impiety and madness. however, this is based on spurious information, as the epitath of apis from 524 bc shows that cambyses participated in the funeral rites of apis styling himself as pharaoh.following the conquest of egypt, the libyans and the greeks of cyrene and barca in libya surrendered to cambyses and sent tribute without a fight. cambyses then planned invasions of carthage, the oasis of ammon and ethiopia. herodotus claims that the naval invasion of carthage was cancelled because the phoenicians, who made up a large part of cambyses\\' fleet, refused to take up arms against their own people, but modern historians doubt whether an invasion of carthage was ever planned at all. however, cambyses dedicated his efforts to the other two campaigns, aiming to improve the empire\\'s strategic position in africa by conquering the kingdom of meroë and taking strategic positions in the western oases. to this end, he established a garrison at elephantine consisting mainly of jewish soldiers, who remained stationed at elephantine throughout cambyses\\' reign. the invasions of ammon and ethiopia themselves were failures. herodotus claims that the invasion of ethiopia was a failure due to the madness of cambyses and the lack of supplies for his men, but archaeological evidence suggests that the expedition was not a failure, and a fortress at the second cataract of the nile, on the border between egypt and kush, remained in use throughout the achaemenid period.the events surrounding cambyses\\' death and bardiya\\'s succession are greatly debated as there are many conflicting accounts. according to herodotus, as bardiya\\'s assassination had been committed in secret, the majority of persians still believed him to be alive. this allowed two magi to rise up against cambyses, with one of them sitting on the throne able to impersonate bardiya because of their remarkable physical resemblance and shared name (smerdis in herodotus\\' accounts). ctesias writes that when cambyses had bardiya killed he immediately put the magus sphendadates in his place as satrap of bactria due to a remarkable physical resemblance. two of cambyses\\' confidants then conspired to usurp cambyses and put sphendadates on the throne under the guise of bardiya. according to the behistun inscription, written by the following king darius the great, a magus named gaumata impersonated bardiya and incited a revolution in persia. whatever the exact circumstances of the revolt, cambyses heard news of it in the summer of 522 bc and began to return from egypt, but he was wounded in the thigh in syria and died of gangrene, so bardiya\\'s impersonator became king. the account of darius is the earliest, and although the later historians all agree on the key details of the story, that a magus impersonated bardiya and took the throne, this may have been a story created by darius to justify his own usurpation. iranologist pierre briant hypothesises that bardiya was not killed by cambyses, but waited until his death in the summer of 522 bc to claim his legitimate right to the throne as he was then the only male descendant of the royal family. briant says that although the hypothesis of a deception by darius is generally accepted today, \"nothing has been established with certainty at the present time, given the available evidence\".\\n\\naccording to the behistun inscription, gaumata ruled for seven months before being overthrown in 522 bc by darius the great (darius i) (old persian dāryavuš, \"who holds firm the good\", also known as darayarahush or darius the great). the magi, though persecuted, continued to exist, and a year following the death of the first pseudo-smerdis (gaumata), saw a second pseudo-smerdis (named vahyazdāta) attempt a coup. the coup, though initially successful, failed.herodotus writes that the native leadership debated the best form of government for the empire. it was agreed that an oligarchy would divide them against one another, and democracy would bring about mob rule resulting in a charismatic leader resuming the monarchy. therefore, they decided a new monarch was in order, particularly since they were in a position to choose him. darius i was chosen monarch from among the leaders. he was cousin to cambyses ii and bardiya (smerdis), claiming ariaramnes as his ancestor.the achaemenids thereafter consolidated areas firmly under their control. it was cyrus the great and darius the great who, by sound and far-sighted administrative planning, brilliant military manoeuvring, and a humanistic world view, established the greatness of the achaemenids and, in less than thirty years, raised them from an obscure tribe to a world power. it was during the reign of darius the great (darius i) that persepolis was built (518–516 bc) and which would serve as capital for several generations of achaemenid kings. ecbatana (hagmatāna \"city of gatherings\", modern: hamadan) in media was greatly expanded during this period and served as the summer capital.ever since the macedonian king amyntas i surrendered his country to the persians in about 512–511, macedonians and persians were strangers no more as well. subjugation of macedonia was part of persian military operations initiated by darius the great (521–486) in 513—after immense preparations—a huge achaemenid army invaded the balkans and tried to defeat the european scythians roaming to the north of the danube river. darius\\' army subjugated several thracian peoples, and virtually all other regions that touch the european part of the black sea, such as parts of nowadays bulgaria, romania, ukraine, and russia, before it returned to asia minor. darius left in europe one of his commanders named megabazus whose task was to accomplish conquests in the balkans. the persian troops subjugated gold-rich thrace, the coastal greek cities, as well as defeating and conquering the powerful paeonians. finally, megabazus sent envoys to amyntas, demanding acceptance of persian domination, which the macedonians did. the balkans provided many soldiers for the multi-ethnic achaemenid army. many of the macedonian and persian elite intermarried, such as the persian official bubares who married amyntas\\' daughter, gygaea. family ties the macedonian rulers amyntas and alexander enjoyed with bubares ensured them good relations with the persian kings darius and xerxes i. the persian invasion led indirectly to macedonia\\'s rise in power and persia had some common interests in the balkans; with persian aid, the macedonians stood to gain much at the expense of some balkan tribes such as the paeonians and greeks. all in all, the macedonians were \"willing and useful persian allies. macedonian soldiers fought against athens and sparta in xerxes\\' army. the persians referred to both greeks and macedonians as yauna (\"ionians\", their term for \"greeks\"), and to macedonians specifically as yaunã takabara or \"greeks with hats that look like shields\", possibly referring to the macedonian kausia hat.\\n\\nby the 5th century bc the kings of persia were either ruling over or had subordinated territories encompassing not just all of the persian plateau and all of the territories formerly held by the assyrian empire (mesopotamia, the levant, cyprus and egypt), but beyond this all of anatolia and armenia, as well as the southern caucasus and parts of the north caucasus, azerbaijan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, all of bulgaria, paeonia, thrace and macedonia to the north and west, most of the black sea coastal regions, parts of central asia as far as the aral sea, the oxus and jaxartes to the north and north-east, the hindu kush and the western indus basin (corresponding to modern afghanistan and pakistan) to the far east, parts of northern arabia to the south, and parts of northern libya to the south-west, and parts of oman, china, and the uae.\\n\\n\\n=== greco-persian wars ===\\n\\nthe ionian revolt in 499 bc, and associated revolts in aeolis, doris, cyprus and caria, were military rebellions by several regions of asia minor against persian rule, lasting from 499 to 493 bc. at the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the greek cities of asia minor with the tyrants appointed by persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two milesian tyrants, histiaeus and aristagoras. in 499 bc, the then tyrant of miletus, aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the persian satrap artaphernes to conquer naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in miletus (both financially and in terms of prestige). the mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, aristagoras chose to incite the whole of ionia into rebellion against the persian king darius the great.the persians continued to reduce the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement in 493 bc on ionia that was generally considered to be both just and fair. the ionian revolt constituted the first major conflict between greece and the achaemenid empire, and as such represents the first phase of the greco-persian wars. asia minor had been brought back into the persian fold, but darius had vowed to punish athens and eretria for their support of the revolt. moreover, seeing that the political situation in greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all of greece. the first campaign of the invasion was to bring the territories in the balkan peninsula back within the empire. the persian grip over these territories had loosened following the ionian revolt. in 492 bc, the persian general mardonius re-subjugated thrace and made macedon a fully subordinate part of the empire; it had been a vassal as early as the late 6th century bc, but retained a great deal of autonomy. however, in 490 bc the persian forces were defeated by the athenians at the battle of marathon and darius would die before having the chance to launch an invasion of greece.xerxes i (485–465 bc, old persian xšayārša \"hero among kings\"), son of darius i, vowed to complete the job. he organized a massive invasion aiming to conquer greece. his army entered greece from the north, meeting little or no resistance through macedonia and thessaly, but was delayed by a small greek force for three days at thermopylae. a simultaneous naval battle at artemisium was tactically indecisive as large storms destroyed ships from both sides. the battle was stopped prematurely when the greeks received news of the defeat at thermopylae and retreated. the battle was a strategic victory for the persians, giving them uncontested control of artemisium and the aegean sea.following his victory at the battle of thermopylae, xerxes sacked the evacuated city of athens and prepared to meet the greeks at the strategic isthmus of corinth and the saronic gulf. in 480 bc the greeks won a decisive victory over the persian fleet at the battle of salamis and forced xerxes to retire to sardis. the land army which he left in greece under mardonius retook athens but was eventually destroyed in 479 bc at the battle of plataea. the final defeat of the persians at mycale encouraged the greek cities of asia to revolt, and the persians lost all of their territories in europe; macedonia once again became independent.\\n\\n\\n=== cultural phase ===\\nafter xerxes i was assassinated, he was succeeded by his eldest son artaxerxes i. it was during his reign that elamite ceased to be the language of government, and aramaic gained in importance. it was probably during this reign that the solar calendar was introduced as the national calendar. under artaxerxes i, zoroastrianism became the de facto religion of state.after persia had been defeated at the battle of eurymedon (469 bc or 466 bc), military action between greece and persia was halted. when artaxerxes i took power, he introduced a new persian strategy of weakening the athenians by funding their enemies in greece. this indirectly caused the athenians to move the treasury of the delian league from the island of delos to the athenian acropolis. this funding practice inevitably prompted renewed fighting in 450 bc, where the greeks attacked at the battle of cyprus. after cimon\\'s failure to attain much in this expedition, the peace of callias was agreed between athens, argos and persia in 449 bc.artaxerxes i offered asylum to themistocles, who was the winner of the battle of salamis, after themistocles was ostracized from athens. also, artaxerxes i gave him magnesia, myus, and lampsacus to maintain him in bread, meat, and wine. in addition, artaxerxes i gave him palaescepsis to provide him with clothes, and he also gave him percote with bedding for his house.\\n\\nwhen artaxerxes died in 424 bc at susa, his body was taken to the tomb already built for him in the naqsh-e rustam necropolis. it was persian tradition that kings begin constructing their own tombs while they were still alive. artaxerxes i was immediately succeeded by his eldest son xerxes ii, who was the only legitimate son of artaxerxes. however, after a few days on the throne, he was assassinated while drunk by pharnacyas and menostanes on the orders of his illegitimate brother: sogdianus who apparently had gained the support of his regions. he reigned for six months and fifteen days before being captured by his half-brother, ochus, who had rebelled against him. sogdianus was executed by being suffocated in ash because ochus had promised he would not die by the sword, by poison or by hunger. ochus then took the royal name darius ii. darius\\' ability to defend his position on the throne ended the short power vacuum.from 412 bc darius ii, at the insistence of tissaphernes, gave support first to athens, then to sparta, but in 407 bc, darius\\' son cyrus the younger was appointed to replace tissaphernes and aid was given entirely to sparta which finally defeated athens in 404 bc. in the same year, darius fell ill and died in babylon. his death gave an egyptian rebel named amyrtaeus the opportunity to throw off persian control over egypt. at his death bed, darius\\' babylonian wife parysatis pleaded with him to have her second eldest son cyrus (the younger) crowned, but darius refused. queen parysatis favoured cyrus more than her eldest son artaxerxes ii. plutarch relates (probably on the authority of ctesias) that the displaced tissaphernes came to the new king on his coronation day to warn him that his younger brother cyrus (the younger) was preparing to assassinate him during the ceremony. artaxerxes had cyrus arrested and would have had him executed if their mother parysatis had not intervened. cyrus was then sent back as satrap of lydia, where he prepared an armed rebellion. cyrus assembled a large army, including a contingent of ten thousand greek mercenaries, and made his way deeper into persia. the army of cyrus was stopped by the royal persian army of artaxerxes ii at cunaxa in 401 bc, where cyrus was killed. the ten thousand greek mercenaries including xenophon were now deep in persian territory and were at risk of attack. so they searched for others to offer their services to but eventually had to return to greece.artaxerxes ii was the longest reigning of the achaemenid kings and it was during this 45-year period of relative peace and stability that many of the monuments of the era were constructed. artaxerxes moved the capital back to persepolis, which he greatly extended. also the summer capital at ecbatana was lavishly extended with gilded columns and roof tiles of silver and copper. the extraordinary innovation of the zoroastrian shrines can also be dated to his reign, and it was probably during this period that zoroastrianism spread from armenia throughout asia minor and the levant. the construction of temples, though serving a religious purpose, was not a purely selfless act, as they also served as an important source of income. from the babylonian kings, the achaemenids had taken over the concept of a mandatory temple tax, a one-tenth tithe which all inhabitants paid to the temple nearest to their land or other source of income. a share of this income called the quppu sha sharri, \"king\\'s chest\"—an ingenious institution originally introduced by nabonidus—was then turned over to the ruler. in retrospect, artaxerxes is generally regarded as an amiable man who lacked the moral fiber to be a really successful ruler. however, six centuries later ardeshir i, founder of the second persian empire, would consider himself artaxerxes\\' successor, a grand testimony to the importance of artaxerxes to the persian psyche.\\n\\nartaxerxes ii became involved in a war with persia\\'s erstwhile allies, the spartans, who, under agesilaus ii, invaded asia minor. in order to redirect the spartans\\' attention to greek affairs, artaxerxes ii subsidized their enemies: in particular the athenians, thebans and corinthians. these subsidies helped to engage the spartans in what would become known as the corinthian war. in 387 bc, artaxerxes ii betrayed his allies and came to an arrangement with sparta, and in the treaty of antalcidas he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. this treaty restored control of the greek cities of ionia and aeolis on the anatolian coast to the persians, while giving sparta dominance on the greek mainland. in 385 bc he campaigned against the cadusians. although successful against the greeks, artaxerxes ii had more trouble with the egyptians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign. an attempt to reconquer egypt in 373 bc was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years the persians did manage to defeat a joint egyptian–spartan effort to conquer phoenicia. he quashed the revolt of the satraps in 372–362 bc. he is reported to have had a number of wives. his main wife was stateira, until she was poisoned by artaxerxes ii\\'s mother parysatis in about 400 bc. another chief wife was a greek woman of phocaea named aspasia (not the same as the concubine of pericles). artaxerxes ii is said to have had more than 115 sons from 350 wives.in 358 bc artaxerxes ii died and was succeeded by his son artaxerxes iii. in 355 bc, artaxerxes iii forced athens to conclude a peace which required the city\\'s forces to leave asia minor and to acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies. artaxerxes started a campaign against the rebellious cadusians, but he managed to appease both of the cadusian kings. one individual who successfully emerged from this campaign was darius codomannus, who later occupied the persian throne as darius iii.artaxerxes iii then ordered the disbanding of all the satrapal armies of asia minor, as he felt that they could no longer guarantee peace in the west and was concerned that these armies equipped the western satraps with the means to revolt. the order was however ignored by artabazos ii of phrygia, who asked for the help of athens in a rebellion against the king. athens sent assistance to sardis. orontes of mysia also supported artabazos and the combined forces managed to defeat the forces sent by artaxerxes iii in 354 bc. however, in 353 bc, they were defeated by artaxerxes iii\\'s army and were disbanded. orontes was pardoned by the king, while artabazos fled to the safety of the court of philip ii of macedon. in around 351 bc, artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover egypt, which had revolted under his father, artaxerxes ii. at the same time a rebellion had broken out in asia minor, which, being supported by thebes, threatened to become serious. levying a vast army, artaxerxes marched into egypt, and engaged nectanebo ii. after a year of fighting the egyptian pharaoh, nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the persians with the support of mercenaries led by the greek generals diophantus and lamius. artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer egypt. soon after this defeat, there were rebellions in phoenicia, asia minor and cyprus.\\n\\nin 343 bc, artaxerxes committed responsibility for the suppression of the cyprian rebels to idrieus, prince of caria, who employed 8,000 greek mercenaries and forty triremes, commanded by phocion the athenian, and evagoras, son of the elder evagoras, the cypriot monarch. idrieus succeeded in reducing cyprus. artaxerxes initiated a counter-offensive against sidon by commanding belesys, satrap of syria, and mazaeus, satrap of cilicia, to invade the city and to keep the phoenicians in check. both satraps suffered crushing defeats at the hands of tennes, the sidonese king, who was aided by 40,000 greek mercenaries sent to him by nectanebo ii and commanded by mentor of rhodes. as a result, the persian forces were driven out of phoenicia.after this, artaxerxes personally led an army of 330,000 men against sidon. artaxerxes\\' army comprised 300,000 foot soldiers, 30,000 cavalry, 300 triremes, and 500 transports or provision ships. after gathering this army, he sought assistance from the greeks. though refused aid by athens and sparta, he succeeded in obtaining a thousand theban heavy-armed hoplites under lacrates, three thousand argives under nicostratus, and six thousand æolians, ionians, and dorians from the greek cities of asia minor. this greek support was numerically small, amounting to no more than 10,000 men, but it formed, together with the greek mercenaries from egypt who went over to him afterwards, the force on which he placed his chief reliance, and to which the ultimate success of his expedition was mainly due. the approach of artaxerxes sufficiently weakened the resolution of tennes that he endeavoured to purchase his own pardon by delivering up 100 principal citizens of sidon into the hands of the persian king, and then admitting artaxerxes within the defences of the town. artaxerxes had the 100 citizens transfixed with javelins, and when 500 more came out as supplicants to seek his mercy, artaxerxes consigned them to the same fate. sidon was then burnt to the ground, either by artaxerxes or by the sidonian citizens. forty thousand people died in the conflagration. artaxerxes sold the ruins at a high price to speculators, who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures which they hoped to dig out from among the ashes. tennes was later put to death by artaxerxes. artaxerxes later sent jews who supported the revolt to hyrcania on the south coast of the caspian sea.\\n\\n\\n=== second conquest of egypt ===\\n\\nthe reduction of sidon was followed closely by the invasion of egypt. in 343 bc, artaxerxes, in addition to his 330,000 persians, had now a force of 14,000 greeks furnished by the greek cities of asia minor: 4,000 under mentor, consisting of the troops that he had brought to the aid of tennes from egypt; 3,000 sent by argos; and 1000 from thebes. he divided these troops into three bodies, and placed at the head of each a persian and a greek. the greek commanders were lacrates of thebes, mentor of rhodes and nicostratus of argos while the persians were led by rhossaces, aristazanes, and bagoas, the chief of the eunuchs. nectanebo ii resisted with an army of 100,000 of whom 20,000 were greek mercenaries. nectanebo ii occupied the nile and its various branches with his large navy.the character of the country, intersected by numerous canals and full of strongly fortified towns, was in his favour and nectanebo ii might have been expected to offer a prolonged, if not even a successful, resistance. however, he lacked good generals, and, over-confident in his own powers of command, he was out-manoeuvred by the greek mercenary generals and his forces were eventually defeated by the combined persian armies at the battle of pelusium (343 bc). after his defeat, nectanebo hastily fled to memphis, leaving the fortified towns to be defended by their garrisons. these garrisons consisted of partly greek and partly egyptian troops; between whom jealousies and suspicions were easily sown by the persian leaders. as a result, the persians were able to rapidly reduce numerous towns across lower egypt and were advancing upon memphis when nectanebo decided to quit the country and flee southwards to ethiopia. the persian army completely routed the egyptians and occupied the lower delta of the nile. following nectanebo fleeing to ethiopia, all of egypt submitted to artaxerxes. the jews in egypt were sent either to babylon or to the south coast of the caspian sea, the same location that the jews of phoenicia had earlier been sent.after this victory over the egyptians, artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed, started a reign of terror, and set about looting all the temples. persia gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken egypt enough that it could never revolt against persia. for the 10 years that persia controlled egypt, believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen. before he returned to persia, he appointed pherendares as satrap of egypt. with the wealth gained from his reconquering egypt, artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries. he then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion of egypt.after his success in egypt, artaxerxes returned to persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the empire so that a few years after his conquest of egypt, the persian empire was firmly under his control. egypt remained a part of the persian empire until alexander the great\\'s conquest of egypt.after the conquest of egypt, there were no more revolts or rebellions against artaxerxes. mentor and bagoas, the two generals who had most distinguished themselves in the egyptian campaign, were advanced to posts of the highest importance. mentor, who was governor of the entire asiatic seaboard, was successful in reducing to subjection many of the chiefs who during the recent troubles had rebelled against persian rule. in the course of a few years mentor and his forces were able to bring the whole asian mediterranean coast into complete submission and dependence.bagoas went back to the persian capital with artaxerxes, where he took a leading role in the internal administration of the empire and maintained tranquillity throughout the rest of the empire. during the last six years of the reign of artaxerxes iii, the persian empire was governed by a vigorous and successful government.the persian forces in ionia and lycia regained control of the aegean and the mediterranean sea and took over much of athens\\' former island empire. in response, isocrates of athens started giving speeches calling for a \\'crusade against the barbarians\\' but there was not enough strength left in any of the greek city-states to answer his call.although there were no rebellions in the persian empire itself, the growing power and territory of philip ii of macedon in macedon (against which demosthenes was in vain warning the athenians) attracted the attention of artaxerxes. in response, he ordered that persian influence was to be used to check and constrain the rising power and influence of the macedonian kingdom. in 340 bc, a persian force was dispatched to assist the thracian prince, cersobleptes, to maintain his independence. sufficient effective aid was given to the city of perinthus that the numerous and well-appointed army with which philip had commenced his siege of the city was compelled to give up the attempt. by the last year of artaxerxes\\' rule, philip ii already had plans in place for an invasion of the persian empire, which would crown his career, but the greeks would not unite with him.in 338 bc artaxerxes was poisoned by bagoas with the assistance of a physician.\\n\\n\\n=== fall of the empire ===\\n\\nartaxerxes iii was succeeded by artaxerxes iv arses, who before he could act was also poisoned by bagoas. bagoas is further said to have killed not only all arses\\' children, but many of the other princes of the land. bagoas then placed darius iii, a nephew of artaxerxes iv, on the throne. darius iii, previously satrap of armenia, personally forced bagoas to swallow poison. in 334 bc, when darius was just succeeding in subduing egypt again, alexander and his battle-hardened troops invaded asia minor.alexander the great (alexander iii of macedon) defeated the persian armies at granicus (334 bc), followed by issus (333 bc), and lastly at gaugamela (331 bc). afterwards, he marched on susa and persepolis which surrendered in early 330 bc. from persepolis, alexander headed north to pasargadae where he visited the tomb of cyrus, the burial of the man whom he had heard of from the cyropedia.in the ensuing chaos created by alexander\\'s invasion of persia, cyrus\\'s tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. when alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which it had been treated, and questioned the magi, putting them on trial. by some accounts, alexander\\'s decision to put the magi on trial was more an attempt to undermine their influence and display his own power than a show of concern for cyrus\\'s tomb. regardless, alexander the great ordered aristobulus to improve the tomb\\'s condition and restore its interior, showing respect for cyrus. from there he headed to ecbatana, where darius iii had sought refuge.darius iii was taken prisoner by bessus, his bactrian satrap and kinsman. as alexander approached, bessus had his men murder darius iii and then declared himself darius\\' successor, as artaxerxes v, before retreating into central asia leaving darius\\' body in the road to delay alexander, who brought it to persepolis for an honourable funeral. bessus would then create a coalition of his forces, in order to create an army to defend against alexander. before bessus could fully unite with his confederates at the eastern part of the empire, alexander, fearing the danger of bessus gaining control, found him, put him on trial in a persian court under his control, and ordered his execution in a \"cruel and barbarous manner.\"alexander generally kept the original achaemenid administrative structure, leading some scholars to dub him as \"the last of the achaemenids\". upon alexander\\'s death in 323 bc, his empire was divided among his generals, the diadochi, resulting in a number of smaller states. the largest of these, which held sway over the iranian plateau, was the seleucid empire, ruled by alexander\\'s general seleucus i nicator. native iranian rule would be restored by the parthians of northeastern iran over the course of the 2nd century bc.\\n\\n\\n=== descendants in later persian dynasties ===\\n\"frataraka\" governors of the seleucid empire\\n\\nseveral later persian rulers, forming the frataraka dynasty, are known to have acted as representatives of the seleucids in the region of fārs. they ruled from the end of the 3rd century bc to the beginning of the 2nd century bc, and vahbarz or vādfradād i obtained independence circa 150 bc, when seleucid power waned in the areas of southwestern persia and the persian gulf region.\\nkings of persis, under the parthian empire\\n\\nduring an apparent transitional period, corresponding to the reigns of vādfradād ii and another uncertain king, no titles of authority appeared on the reverse of their coins. the earlier title prtrk\\' zy alhaya (frataraka) had disappeared. under dārēv i however, the new title of mlk, or king, appeared, sometimes with the mention  of prs (persis), suggesting that the kings of persis had become independent rulers.when the parthian arsacid king mithridates i (c. 171–138 bc) took control of persis, he left the persian dynasts in office, known as the kings of persis, and they were allowed to continue minting coins with the title of mlk (\"king\").\\nsasanian empire\\nwith the reign of šābuhr, the son of pāpag, the kingdom of persis then became a part of the sasanian empire. šābuhr\\'s brother and successor, ardaxšir (artaxerxes) v, defeated the last legitimate parthian king, artabanos v in 224 ce, and was crowned at ctesiphon as ardaxšir i (ardashir i), šāhanšāh ī ērān, becoming the first king of the new sasanian empire.\\nkingdom of pontusthe achaemenid line would also be carried on through the kingdom of pontus, based in the pontus region of northern asia minor. this pontic kingdom, a state of persian origin, may even have been directly related to darius the great and the achaemenid dynasty. it was founded by mithridates i in 281 bc and lasted until its conquest by the roman republic in 63 bc. the kingdom grew to its largest extent under mithridates vi the great, who conquered colchis, cappadocia, bithynia, the greek colonies of the tauric chersonesos and for a brief time the roman province of asia. thus, this persian dynasty managed to survive and prosper in the hellenistic world while the main persian empire had fallen.\\n\\nboth the later dynasties of the parthians and sasanians would on occasion claim achaemenid descent. recently there has been some corroboration for the parthian claim to achaemenid ancestry via the possibility of an inherited disease (neurofibromatosis) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.\\n\\n\\n=== causes of decline ===\\npart of the cause of the empire\\'s decline had been the heavy tax burden put upon the state, which eventually led to economic decline. an estimate of the tribute imposed on the subject nations was up to u.s. $180m per year. this does not include the material goods and supplies that were supplied as taxes. after the high overhead of government—the military, the bureaucracy, whatever the satraps could safely dip into the coffers for themselves—this money went into the royal treasury. according to diodorus, at persepolis, alexander iii found some 180,000 attic talents of silver besides the additional treasure the macedonians were carrying that already had been seized in damascus by parmenion. this amounted to u.s. $2.7b. on top of this, darius iii had taken 8,000 talents with him on his flight to the north. alexander put this static hoard back into the economy, and upon his death some 130,000 talents had been spent on the building of cities, dockyards, temples, and the payment of the troops, besides the ordinary government expenses. additionally, one of the satraps, harpalus, had made off to greece with some 6,000 talents, which athens used to rebuild its economy after seizing it during the struggles with the corinthian league. due to the flood of money from alexander\\'s hoard entering greece, however, a disruption in the economy occurred, in agriculture, banking, rents, the great increase in mercenary soldiers that cash allowed the wealthy, and an increase in piracy.another factor contributing to the decline of the empire, in the period following xerxes, was its failure to ever mold the many subject nations into a whole; the creation of a national identity was never attempted. this lack of cohesion eventually affected the efficiency of the military.\\n\\n\\n== government ==\\n\\ncyrus the great founded the empire as a multi-state empire, governed from four capital cities: pasargadae, babylon, susa and ecbatana. the achaemenids allowed a certain amount of regional autonomy in the form of the satrapy system. a satrapy was an administrative unit, usually organized on a geographical basis. a \\'satrap\\' (governor) was the governor who administered the region, a \\'general\\' supervised military recruitment and ensured order, and a \\'state secretary\\' kept the official records. the general and the state secretary reported directly to the satrap as well as the central government. at differing times, there were between 20 and 30 satrapies.cyrus the great created an organized army including the immortals unit, consisting of 10,000 highly trained soldiers cyrus also formed an innovative postal system throughout the empire, based on several relay stations called chapar khaneh.\\n\\n\\n=== achaemenid coinage ===\\n\\nthe persian daric was the first gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the siglos, introduced the bimetallic monetary standard of the achaemenid persian empire which has continued till today. this was accomplished by darius the great, who reinforced the empire and expanded persepolis as a ceremonial capital; he revolutionized the economy by placing it on the silver and gold coinage.\\n\\n\\n=== tax districts ===\\n\\ndarius also introduced a regulated and sustainable tax system that was precisely tailored to each satrapy, based on their supposed productivity and their economic potential. for instance, babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities – 1000 silver talents, four months supply of food for the army. india was clearly already fabled for its gold; egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the persian empire (as later of rome\\'s) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. this was exclusively a tax levied on subject peoples.\\n\\nother accomplishments of darius\\' reign included codification of the data, a universal legal system, and construction of a new capital at persepolis.under the achaemenids, the trade was extensive and there was an efficient infrastructure that facilitated the exchange of commodities in the far reaches of the empire. tariffs on trade were one of the empire\\'s main sources of revenue, along with agriculture and tribute.the satrapies were linked by a 2,500-kilometer highway, the most impressive stretch being the royal road from susa to sardis, built by command of darius i. it featured stations and caravanserais at specific intervals. the relays of mounted couriers (the angarium) could reach the remotest of areas in fifteen days. herodotus observes that \"there is nothing in the world that travels faster than these persian couriers. neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these courageous couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.\" despite the relative local independence afforded by the satrapy system, royal inspectors, the \"eyes and ears of the king\", toured the empire and reported on local conditions.there is evidence that conquered and/or rebellious enemies could be sold into slavery. alongside its other innovations in administration and taxation, the achaemenids may have been the first government in the ancient near east to register private slave sales and tax them using an early form of sales tax.\\n\\n\\n== military ==\\ndespite its humble origins in persis, the empire reached an enormous size under the leadership of cyrus the great. cyrus created a multi-state empire where he allowed regional rulers, called the \"satrap\", to rule as his proxy over a certain designated area of his empire called the satrapy. the basic rule of governance was based upon loyalty and obedience of each satrapy to the central power, or the king, and compliance with tax laws. due to the ethno-cultural diversity of the subject nations under the rule of persia, its enormous geographic size, and the constant struggle for power by regional competitors, the creation of a professional army was necessary for both maintenance of the peace and to enforce the authority of the king in cases of rebellion and foreign threat. cyrus managed to create a strong land army, using it to advance in his campaigns in babylonia, lydia, and asia minor, which after his death was used by his son cambyses ii, in egypt against psamtik iii. cyrus would die battling a local iranian insurgency in the empire, before he could have a chance to develop a naval force. that task would fall to darius the great, who would officially give persians their own royal navy to allow them to engage their enemies on multiple seas of this vast empire, from the black sea and the aegean sea, to the persian gulf, ionian sea and the mediterranean sea.\\n\\n\\n=== military composition ===\\n\\nthe empire\\'s great armies were, like the empire itself, very diverse, having: persians, macedonians, european thracians, paeonians, medes, achaean greeks, cissians, hyrcanians, assyrians, chaldeans, bactrians, sacae, arians, parthians, caucasian albanians, chorasmians, sogdians, gandarians, dadicae, caspians, sarangae, pactyes, utians, mycians, phoenicians, judeans, egyptians, cyprians, cilicians, pamphylians, lycians, dorians of asia, carians, ionians, aegean islanders, aeolians, greeks from pontus, paricanians, arabians, ethiopians of africa, ethiopians of baluchistan, libyans, paphlagonians, ligyes, matieni, mariandyni, cappadocians, phrygians, armenians, lydians, mysians, asian thracians, lasonii, milyae, moschi, tibareni, macrones, mossynoeci, mares, colchians, alarodians, saspirians, red sea islanders, sagartians, indians, eordi, bottiaei, chalcidians, brygians, pierians, perrhaebi, enienes, dolopes, and magnesians.\\n\\n\\n=== infantry ===\\n\\nthe achaemenid infantry consisted of three groups: the immortals, the sparabara, and the takabara, though in the later years of the achaemenid empire, the cardaces, were introduced.the immortals were described by herodotus as being heavy infantry, led by hydarnes, that were kept constantly at a strength of exactly 10,000 men. he claimed that the unit\\'s name stemmed from the custom that every killed, seriously wounded, or sick member was immediately replaced with a new one, maintaining the numbers and cohesion of the unit. they had wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow. underneath their robes they wore scale armour coats. the spear counterbalances of the common soldiery were of silver; to differentiate commanding ranks, the officers\\' spear butt-spikes were golden. surviving achaemenid coloured glazed bricks and carved reliefs represent the immortals as wearing elaborate robes, hoop earrings and gold jewellery, though these garments and accessories were most likely worn only for ceremonial occasions.\\n\\nthe sparabara were usually the first to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. although not much is known about them today, it is believed that they were the backbone of the persian army who formed a shield wall and used their two-metre-long spears to protect more vulnerable troops such as archers from the enemy. the sparabara were taken from the full members of persian society, they were trained from childhood to be soldiers and when not called out to fight on campaigns in distant lands they practised hunting on the vast plains of persia. however, when all was quiet and the pax persica held true, the sparabara returned to normal life farming the land and grazing their herds. because of this they lacked true professional quality on the battlefield, yet they were well trained and courageous to the point of holding the line in most situations long enough for a counter-attack. they were armoured with quilted linen and carried large rectangular wicker shields as a form of light manoeuvrable defence. this, however, left them at a severe disadvantage against heavily armoured opponents such as the hoplite, and his two-metre-long spear was not able to give the sparabara ample range to plausibly engage a trained phalanx. the wicker shields were able to effectively stop arrows but not strong enough to protect the soldier from spears. however, the sparabara could deal with most other infantry, including trained units from the east.the achaemenids relied heavily on archery. major contributing nations were the scythians, medes, persians, and the elamites. the composite bow was used by the persians and medes, who adopted it from the scythians and transmitted it to other nations, including the greeks. the socketed, three-bladed (also known as trilobate or scythian) arrowheads made of copper alloy was the arrowhead variant normally used by the achaemenid army. this variant required more expertise and precision to build.the takabara were a rare unit who were a tough type of peltasts. they tended to fight with their own native weapons which would have included a crescent-shaped light wickerwork shield and axes as well as light linen cloth and leather. the takabara were recruited from territories that incorporated modern iran.\\n\\n\\n=== cavalry ===\\n\\nthe persian cavalry was crucial for conquering nations, and maintained its importance in the achaemenid army to the last days of the achaemenid empire. the cavalry were separated into four groups. the chariot archers, horse cavalry, the camel cavalry, and the war elephants.\\n\\nin the later years of the achaemenid empire, the chariot archer had become merely a ceremonial part of the persian army, yet in the early years of the empire, their use was widespread. the chariot archers were armed with spears, bows, arrows, swords, and scale armour. the horses were also suited with scale armour similar to scale armour of the sassanian cataphracts. the chariots would contain imperial symbols and decorations.\\n\\nthe horses used by the achaemenids for cavalry were often suited with scale armour, like most cavalry units. the riders often had the same armour as infantry units, wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow and scale armour coats. the camel cavalry was different, because the camels and sometimes the riders, were provided little protection against enemies, yet when they were offered protection, they would have spears, swords, bow, arrow, and scale armour. the camel cavalry was first introduced into the persian army by cyrus the great, at the battle of thymbra. the elephant was most likely introduced into the persian army by darius i after his conquest of the indus valley. they may have been used in greek campaigns by darius and xerxes i, but greek accounts only mention 15 of them being used at the battle of gaugamela.\\n\\n\\n=== navy ===\\nsince its foundation by cyrus, the persian empire had been primarily a land empire with a strong army, but void of any actual naval forces. by the 5th century bc, this was to change, as the empire came across greek, and egyptian forces, each with their own maritime traditions and capabilities. darius the great (darius i) was the first achaemenid king to invest in a persian fleet. even by then no true \"imperial navy\" had existed either in greece or egypt. persia would become the first empire, under darius, to inaugurate and deploy the first regular imperial navy. despite this achievement, the personnel for the imperial navy would not come from iran, but were often phoenicians (mostly from sidon), egyptians and greeks chosen by darius the great to operate the empire\\'s combat vessels.\\n\\nat first the ships were built in sidon by the phoenicians; the first achaemenid ships measured about 40 meters in length and 6 meters in width, able to transport up to 300 persian troops at any one trip. soon, other states of the empire were constructing their own ships, each incorporating slight local preferences. the ships eventually found their way to the persian gulf. persian naval forces laid the foundation for a strong persian maritime presence in the persian gulf. persians were not only stationed on islands in the persian gulf, but also had ships often of 100 to 200 capacity patrolling the empire\\'s various rivers including the karun, tigris and nile in the west, as well as the indus.\\n\\nthe achaemenid navy established bases located along the karun, and in bahrain, oman, and yemen. the persian fleet was not only used for peace-keeping purposes along the karun but also opened the door to trade with india via the persian gulf. darius\\'s navy was in many ways a world power at the time, but it would be artaxerxes ii who in the summer of 397 bc would build a formidable navy, as part of a rearmament which would lead to his decisive victory at knidos in 394 bc, re-establishing achaemenid power in ionia. artaxerxes ii would also utilize his navy to later on quell a rebellion in egypt.the construction material of choice was wood, but some armoured achaemenid ships had metallic blades on the front, often meant to slice enemy ships using the ship\\'s momentum. naval ships were also equipped with hooks on the side to grab enemy ships, or to negotiate their position. the ships were propelled by sails or manpower. the ships the persians created were unique. as far as maritime engagement, the ships were equipped with two mangonels that would launch projectiles such as stones, or flammable substances.xenophon describes his eyewitness account of a massive military bridge created by joining 37 persian ships across the tigris. the persians utilized each boat\\'s buoyancy, in order to support a connected bridge above which supply could be transferred. herodotus also gives many accounts of persians utilizing ships to build bridges.darius the great, in an attempt to subdue the scythian horsemen north of the black sea, crossed over at the bosphorus, using an enormous bridge made by connecting achaemenid boats, then marched up to the danube, crossing it by means of a second boat bridge. the bridge over the bosphorus essentially connected the nearest tip of asia to europe, encompassing at least some 1000 meters of open water if not more. herodotus describes the spectacle, and calls it the \"bridge of darius\":\\n\"strait called bosphorus, across which the bridge of darius had been thrown is hundred and twenty furlongs in length, reaching from the euxine, to the propontis. the propontis is five hundred furlongs across, and fourteen hundred long. its waters flow into the hellespont, the length of which is four hundred furlongs ...\"years later, a similar boat bridge would be constructed by xerxes the great (xerxes i), in his invasion of greece. although the persians failed to capture the greek city states completely, the tradition of maritime involvement was carried down by the persian kings, most notably artaxerxes ii. years later, when alexander invaded persia and during his advancement into india, he took a page from the persian art of war, by having hephaestion and perdiccas construct a similar boat-bridge at the indus river, in india in the spring of 327 bc.\\n\\n\\n== culture ==\\n\\nherodotus, in his mid-5th century bc account of persian residents of the pontus, reports that persian youths, from their fifth year to their twentieth year, were instructed in three things—to ride a horse, to draw a bow, and to speak the truth.he further notes that:\\nthe most disgraceful thing in the world [the persians] think, is to tell a lie; the next worst, to owe a debt: because, among other reasons, the debtor is obliged to tell lies.in achaemenid persia, the lie, druj, is considered to be a cardinal sin, and it was punishable by death in some extreme cases. tablets discovered by archaeologists in the 1930s at the site of persepolis give us adequate evidence about the love and veneration for the culture of truth during the achaemenian period. these tablets contain the names of ordinary persians, mainly traders and warehouse-keepers. according to stanley insler of yale university, as many as 72 names of officials and petty clerks found on these tablets contain the word truth. thus, says insler, we have artapana, protector of truth, artakama, lover of truth, artamanah, truth-minded, artafarnah, possessing splendour of truth, artazusta, delighting in truth, artastuna, pillar of truth, artafrida, prospering the truth and artahunara, having nobility of truth. it was darius the great who laid down the ordinance of good regulations during his reign. king darius\\' testimony about his constant battle against the lie is found in cuneiform inscriptions. carved high up in the behistun mountain on the road to kermanshah, darius the great (darius i) testifies:\\ni was not a lie-follower, i was not a doer of wrong ... according to righteousness i conducted myself. neither to the weak or to the powerful did i do wrong. the man who cooperated with my house, him i rewarded well; who so did injury, him i punished well.darius had his hands full dealing with large-scale rebellion which broke out throughout the empire. after fighting successfully with nine traitors in a year, darius records his battles against them for posterity and tells us how it was the lie that made them rebel against the empire. at behistun, darius says:\\n\\ni smote them and took prisoner nine kings. one was gaumata by name, a magian; he lied; thus he said: i am smerdis, the son of cyrus ... one, acina by name, an elamite; he lied; thus he said: i am king in elam ... one, nidintu-bel by name, a babylonian; he lied; thus he said: i am nebuchadnezzar, the son of nabonidus.king darius then tells us,\\n\\nthe lie made them rebellious, so that these men deceived the people.then advice to his son xerxes, who is to succeed him as the great king:\\n\\nthou who shalt be king hereafter, protect yourself vigorously from the lie; the man who shall be a lie-follower, him do thou punish well, if thus thou shall think. may my country be secure!\\n\\n\\n=== languages ===\\n\\nduring the reign of cyrus and darius, and as long as the seat of government was still at susa in elam, the language of the chancellery was elamite. this is primarily attested in the persepolis fortification and treasury tablets that reveal details of the day-to-day functioning of the empire. in the grand rock-face inscriptions of the kings, the elamite texts are always accompanied by akkadian (babylonian dialect) and old persian inscriptions, and it appears that in these cases, the elamite texts are translations of the old persian ones. it is then likely that although elamite was used by the capital government in susa, it was not a standardized language of government everywhere in the empire. the use of elamite is not attested after 458 bc.\\n\\nfollowing the conquest of mesopotamia, the aramaic language (as used in that territory) was adopted as a \"vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. the use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed \"official aramaic\" or \"imperial aramaic\", can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.\" in 1955, richard frye questioned the classification of imperial aramaic as an \"official language\", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language. frye reclassifies imperial aramaic as the lingua franca of the achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the achaemenid-era use of aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought. many centuries after the fall of the empire, aramaic script and—as ideograms—aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the pahlavi writing system.although old persian also appears on some seals and art objects, that language is attested primarily in the achaemenid inscriptions of western iran, suggesting then that old persian was the common language of that region. however, by the reign of artaxerxes ii, the grammar and orthography of the inscriptions was so \"far from perfect\" that it has been suggested that the scribes who composed those texts had already largely forgotten the language, and had to rely on older inscriptions, which they to a great extent reproduced verbatim.when the occasion demanded, achaemenid administrative correspondence was conducted in greek, making it a widely used bureaucratic language. even though the achaemenids had extensive contacts with the greeks and vice versa, and had conquered many of the greek-speaking areas both in europe and asia minor during different periods of the empire, the native old iranian sources provide no indication of greek linguistic evidence. however, there is plenty of evidence (in addition to the accounts of herodotus) that greeks, apart from being deployed and employed in the core regions of the empire, also evidently lived and worked in the heartland of the achaemenid empire, namely iran. for example, greeks were part of the various ethnicities that constructed darius\\' palace in susa, apart from the greek inscriptions found nearby there, and one short persepolis tablet written in greek.\\n\\n\\n=== customs ===\\n\\nherodotus mentions that the persians were invited to great birthday feasts (herodotus, histories 8), which would be followed by many desserts, a treat which they reproached the greeks for omitting from their meals. he also observed that the persians drank wine in large quantities and used it even for counsel, deliberating on important affairs when drunk, and deciding the next day, when sober, whether to act on the decision or set it aside. bowing to superiors, or royalty was one of the many persian customs adopted by alexander the great.\\n\\n\\n=== religion ===\\nreligious toleration has been described as a \"remarkable feature\" of the achaemenid empire.\\nthe old testament reports that king cyrus the great released the jews from their babylonian captivity in 539–530 bc, and permitted them to return to their homeland. cyrus the great assisted in the restoration of the sacred places of various cities.it was during the achaemenid period that zoroastrianism reached south-western iran, where it came to be accepted by the rulers and through them became a defining element of persian culture. the religion was not only accompanied by a formalization of the concepts and divinities of the traditional iranian pantheon but also introduced several novel ideas, including that of free will. under the patronage of the achaemenid kings, and by the 5th century bc as the de facto religion of the state, zoroastrianism reached all corners of the empire.\\n\\nduring the reign of artaxerxes i and darius ii, herodotus wrote \"[the persians] have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and consider the use of them a sign of folly. this comes, i think, from their not believing the gods to have the same nature with men, as the greeks imagine.\" he claims the persians offer sacrifice to: \"the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire, to water, and to the winds. these are the only gods whose worship has come down to them from ancient times. at a later period they began the worship of urania, which they borrowed from the arabians and assyrians. mylitta is the name by which the assyrians know this goddess, to whom the persians referred as anahita.\" (the original name here is mithra, which has since been explained to be a confusion of anahita with mithra, understandable since they were commonly worshipped together in one temple).from the babylonian scholar-priest berosus, who—although writing over seventy years after the reign of artaxerxes ii mnemon—records that the emperor had been the first to make cult statues of divinities and have them placed in temples in many of the major cities of the empire. berosus also substantiates herodotus when he says the persians knew of no images of gods until artaxerxes ii erected those images. on the means of sacrifice, herodotus adds \"they raise no altar, light no fire, pour no libations.\" this sentence has been interpreted to identify a critical (but later) accretion to zoroastrianism. an altar with a wood-burning fire and the yasna service at which libations are poured are all clearly identifiable with modern zoroastrianism, but apparently, were practices that had not yet developed in the mid-5th century. boyce also assigns that development to the reign of artaxerxes ii (4th century bc), as an orthodox response to the innovation of the shrine cults.herodotus also observed that \"no prayer or offering can be made without a magus present\" but this should not be confused with what is today understood by the term magus, that is a magupat (modern persian: mobed), a zoroastrian priest. nor does herodotus\\' description of the term as one of the tribes or castes of the medes necessarily imply that these magi were medians. they simply were a hereditary priesthood to be found all over western iran and although (originally) not associated with any one specific religion, they were traditionally responsible for all ritual and religious services. although the unequivocal identification of the magus with zoroastrianism came later (sassanid era, 3rd–7th century ad), it is from herodotus\\' magus of the mid-5th century that zoroastrianism was subject to doctrinal modifications that are today considered to be revocations of the original teachings of the prophet. also, many of the ritual practices described in the avesta\\'s vendidad (such as exposure of the dead) were already practised by the magu of herodotus\\' time.\\n\\n\\n=== art and architecture ===\\n\\nachaemenid architecture includes large cities, temples, palaces, and mausoleums such as the tomb of cyrus the great. the quintessential feature of persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of median, assyrian, and asiatic greek all incorporated, yet maintaining a unique persian identity seen in the finished products.achaemenid art includes frieze reliefs, metalwork such as the oxus treasure, decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. although the persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique persian style. cyrus the great in fact had an extensive ancient iranian heritage behind him; the rich achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a speciality of the medes, was for instance in the tradition of the delicate metalwork found in iron age ii times at hasanlu and still earlier at marlik.\\n\\none of the most remarkable examples of both achaemenid architecture and art is the grand palace of persepolis, and its detailed workmanship, coupled with its grand scale. in describing the construction of his palace at susa, darius the great records that:\\n\\nyaka timber was brought from gandara and from carmania. the gold was brought from sardis and from bactria ... the precious stone lapis-lazuli and carnelian ... was brought from sogdiana. the turquoise from chorasmia, the silver and ebony from egypt, the ornamentation from ionia, the ivory from ethiopia and from sindh and from arachosia. the stone-cutters who wrought the stone, those were ionians and sardians. the goldsmiths were medes and egyptians. the men who wrought the wood, those were sardians and egyptians. the men who wrought the baked brick, those were babylonians. the men who adorned the wall, those were medes and egyptians.\\nthis was imperial art on a scale the world had not seen before. materials and artists were drawn from all corners of the empire, and thus tastes, styles, and motifs became mixed together in an eclectic art and architecture that in itself mirrored the persian empire.\\n\\n\\n=== tombs ===\\n\\nmany achaemenid rulers built tombs for themselves. the most famous, naqsh-e rustam, is an ancient necropolis located about 12 km north-west of persepolis, with the tombs of four of the kings of the dynasty carved in this mountain: darius i, xerxes i, artaxerxes i and darius ii. other kings constructed their own tombs elsewhere. artaxerxes ii and artaxerxes iii preferred to carve their tombs beside their spring capital persepolis, the left tomb belonging to artaxerxes ii and the right tomb belonging to artaxerxes iii, the last achaemenid king to have a tomb. the tomb of the founder of the achaemenid dynasty, cyrus the great, was built in pasargadae (now a world heritage site).\\n\\n\\n== legacy ==\\n\\nthe achaemenid empire left a lasting impression on the heritage and cultural identity of asia, europe, and the middle east, and influenced the development and structure of future empires. in fact, the greeks, and later on the romans, adopted the best features of the persian method of governing an empire.georg w. f. hegel in his work the philosophy of history introduces the persian empire as the \"first empire that passed away\" and its people as the \"first historical people\" in history. according to his account;\\n\\nthe persian empire is an empire in the modern sense—like that which existed in germany, and the great imperial realm under the sway of napoleon; for we find it consisting of a number of states, which are indeed dependent, but which have retained their own individuality, their manners, and laws. the general enactments, binding upon all, did not infringe upon their political and social idiosyncrasies, but even protected and maintained them; so that each of the nations that constitute the whole, had its own form of constitution. as light illuminates everything—imparting to each object a peculiar vitality—so the persian empire extends over a multitude of nations, and leaves to each one its particular character. some have even kings of their own; each one its distinct language, arms, way of life and customs. all this diversity coexists harmoniously under the impartial dominion of light ... a combination of peoples—leaving each of them free. thereby, a stop is put to that barbarism and ferocity with which the nations had been wont to carry on their destructive feuds.american orientalist arthur upham pope (1881–1969) said: \"the western world has a vast unpaid debt to the persian civilization!\"will durant, the american historian and philosopher, during one of his speeches, \"persia in the history of civilization\", as an address before the iran–america society in tehran on 21 april 1948, stated:\\n\\nfor thousands of years persians have been creating beauty. sixteen centuries before christ there went from these regions or near it ... you have been here a kind of watershed of civilization, pouring your blood and thought and art and religion eastward and westward into the world ... i need not rehearse for you again the achievements of your achaemenid period. then for the first time in known history an empire almost as extensive as the united states received an orderly government, a competence of administration, a web of swift communications, a security of movement by men and goods on majestic roads, equalled before our time only by the zenith of imperial rome.\\n\\n\\n== achaemenid kings and rulers ==\\n\\n\\n=== unattested ===\\nthere were four unattested kings who ruled as satraps to the neo-assyrian empire and the median empire.\\n\\n\\n=== attested ===\\n\\nthere were 13 attested kings during the 220 years of the achaemenid empire\\'s existence. the reign of artaxerxes ii was the longest, lasting 47 years.\\n\\n\\n== gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\n\\nachaemenid family tree\\nachaemenid persian lion rhyton\\nhistory of

              " 'an acid–base reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. it can be used to determine ph. several theoretical frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the acid–base theories, for example, brønsted–lowry acid–base theory.\\ntheir importance becomes apparent in analyzing acid–base reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent. the first of these concepts was provided by the french chemist antoine lavoisier, around 1776.\\n\\nit is important to think of the acid-base reaction models as theories that complement each other. for example, the current lewis model has the broadest definition of what an acid and base are, with the bronsted-lowry theory being a subset of what acids and bases are, and the arrhenius theory being the most restrictive.\\n\\n\\n== acid–base definitions ==\\n\\n\\n=== historic development ===\\n\\n\\n==== lavoisier\\'s oxygen theory of acids ====\\nthe first scientific concept of acids and bases was provided by lavoisier in around 1776. since lavoisier\\'s knowledge of strong acids was mainly restricted to oxoacids, such as hno3 (nitric acid) and h2so4 (sulfuric acid), which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen, and since he was not aware of the true composition of the hydrohalic acids (hf, hcl, hbr, and hi), he defined acids in terms of their containing oxygen, which in fact he named from greek words meaning \"acid-former\" (from the greek οξυς (oxys) meaning \"acid\" or \"sharp\" and γεινομαι (geinomai) meaning \"engender\"). the lavoisier definition held for over 30 years, until the 1810 article and subsequent lectures by sir humphry davy in which he proved the lack of oxygen in h2s, h2te, and the hydrohalic acids. however, davy failed to develop a new theory, concluding that \"acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance, but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances\". one notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by jöns jacob berzelius, who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals.\\n\\n\\n==== liebig\\'s hydrogen theory of acids ====\\nin 1838, justus von liebig proposed that an acid is a hydrogen-containing compound whose hydrogen can be replaced by a metal. this redefinition was based on his extensive work on the chemical composition of organic acids, finishing the doctrinal shift from oxygen-based acids to hydrogen-based acids started by davy. liebig\\'s definition, while completely empirical, remained in use for almost 50 years until the adoption of the arrhenius definition.\\n\\n\\n=== arrhenius definition ===\\n\\nthe first modern definition of acids and bases in molecular terms was devised by svante arrhenius. a hydrogen theory of acids, it followed from his 1884 work with friedrich wilhelm ostwald in establishing the presence of ions in aqueous solution and led to arrhenius receiving the nobel prize in chemistry in 1903.\\nas defined by arrhenius:\\n\\nan arrhenius acid is a substance that dissociates in water to form hydrogen ions (h+); that is, an acid increases the concentration of h+ ions in an aqueous solution.this causes the protonation of water, or the creation of the hydronium (h3o+) ion. thus, in modern times, the symbol h+ is interpreted as a shorthand for h3o+, because it is now known that a bare proton does not exist as a free species in aqueous solution.\\nan arrhenius base is a substance that dissociates in water to form hydroxide (oh−) ions; that is, a base increases the concentration of oh− ions in an aqueous solution.\"the arrhenius definitions of acidity and alkalinity are restricted to aqueous solutions, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. under this definition, pure h2so4 and hcl dissolved in toluene are not acidic, and molten naoh and solutions of calcium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline. this led to the development of the bronsted-lowry theory and subsequent lewis theory to account for these non-aqueous exceptions.overall, to qualify as an arrhenius acid, upon the introduction to water, the chemical must either cause, directly or otherwise:\\n\\nan increase in the aqueous hydronium concentration, or\\na decrease in the aqueous hydroxide concentration.conversely, to qualify as an arrhenius base, upon the introduction to water, the chemical must either cause, directly or otherwise:\\n\\na decrease in the aqueous hydronium concentration, or\\nan increase in the aqueous hydroxide concentration.the reaction of an acid with a base is called a neutralization reaction. the products of this reaction are a salt and water.\\n\\nacid + base → salt + waterin this traditional representation an acid–base neutralization reaction is formulated as a double-replacement reaction. for example, the reaction of hydrochloric acid, hcl, with sodium hydroxide, naoh, solutions produces a solution of sodium chloride, nacl, and some additional water molecules.\\n\\nhcl(aq) + naoh(aq) → nacl(aq) + h2othe modifier (aq) in this equation was implied by arrhenius, rather than included explicitly. it indicates that the substances are dissolved in water. though all three substances, hcl, naoh and nacl are capable of existing as pure compounds, in aqueous solutions they are fully dissociated into the aquated ions h+, cl−, na+ and oh−.\\n\\n\\n=== brønsted–lowry definition ===\\n\\nthe brønsted–lowry definition, formulated in 1923, independently by johannes nicolaus brønsted in denmark and martin lowry in england, is based upon the idea of protonation of bases through the deprotonation of acids – that is, the ability of acids to \"donate\" hydrogen ions (h+)—otherwise known as protons—to bases, which \"accept\" them.an acid–base reaction is, thus, the removal of a hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition to the base. the removal of a hydrogen ion from an acid produces its conjugate base, which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed. the reception of a proton by a base produces its conjugate acid, which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.\\nunlike the previous definitions, the brønsted–lowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent, but instead to the formation of conjugate acids and conjugate bases, produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base. in this approach, acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts, which are seen as electrolytes, subject to the theories of debye, onsager, and others. an acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent, but to form a new acid and a new base. the concept of neutralization is thus absent. brønsted–lowry acid–base behavior is formally independent of any solvent, making it more all-encompassing than the arrhenius model. the calculation of ph under the arrhenius model depended on alkalis (bases) dissolving in water (aqueous solution). the brønsted–lowry model expanded what could be ph tested using insoluble and soluble solutions (gas, liquid, solid).\\nthe general formula for acid–base reactions according to the brønsted–lowry definition is:\\n\\nha + b → bh+ + a−where ha represents the acid, b represents the base, bh+ represents the conjugate acid of b, and a− represents the conjugate base of ha.\\nfor example, a brønsted-lowry model for the dissociation of hydrochloric acid (hcl) in aqueous solution would be the following:\\n\\nhcl + h2o ⇌ h3o+ + cl−the removal of h+ from the hcl produces the chloride ion, cl−, the conjugate base of the acid. the addition of h+ to the h2o (acting as a base) forms the hydronium ion, h3o+, the conjugate acid of the base.\\nwater is amphoteric—that is, it can act as both an acid and a base. the brønsted-lowry model explains this, showing the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions:\\n\\nh2o + h2o ⇌ h3o+ + oh−this equation is demonstrated in the image below:\\n\\nhere, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating an h+ and forming the conjugate base, oh−, and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the h+ ion and forming the conjugate acid, h3o+.\\nas an example of water acting as an acid, consider an aqueous solution of pyridine, c5h5n.\\n\\nc5h5n + h2o ⇌ [c5h5nh]+ + oh−in this example, a water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion, which is donated to a pyridine molecule, and an hydroxide ion.\\nin the brønsted-lowry model, the solvent does not necessarily have to be water that is required by the arrhenius acid-base model. for example, consider what happens when acetic acid, ch3cooh, dissolves in liquid ammonia.\\n\\nch3cooh + nh3 ⇌ nh+4 + ch3coo−an h+ ion is removed from acetic acid, forming its conjugate base, the acetate ion, ch3coo−. the addition of an h+ ion to an ammonia molecule of the solvent creates its conjugate acid, the ammonium ion, nh+4.\\nthe brønsted–lowry model calls hydrogen-containing substances (like hcl) acids. thus, some substances, which many chemists considered to be acids, such as so3 or bcl3, are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen. gilbert n. lewis wrote in 1938, \"to restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen.\" furthermore, koh and knh2 are not considered brønsted bases, but rather salts containing the bases oh− and nh−2.\\n\\n\\n=== lewis definition ===\\n\\nthe hydrogen requirement of arrhenius and brønsted–lowry was removed by the lewis definition of acid–base reactions, devised by gilbert n. lewis in 1923, in the same year as brønsted–lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938. instead of defining acid–base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a lewis base) to be a compound that can donate an electron pair, and an acid (a lewis acid) to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.for example, boron trifluoride, bf3 is a typical lewis acid. it can accept a pair of electrons as it has a vacancy in its octet. the fluoride ion has a full octet and can donate a pair of electrons. thus\\n\\nbf3 + f− → bf−4is a typical lewis acid, lewis base reaction. all compounds of group 13 elements with a formula ax3 can behave as lewis acids. similarly, compounds of group 15 elements with a formula dy3, such as amines, nr3, and phosphines, pr3, can behave as lewis bases. adducts between them have the formula x3a←dy3 with a dative covalent bond, shown symbolically as ←, between the atoms a (acceptor) and d (donor). compounds of group 16 with a formula dx2 may also act as lewis bases; in this way, a compound like an ether, r2o, or a thioether, r2s, can act as a lewis base. the lewis definition is not limited to these examples. for instance, carbon monoxide acts as a lewis base when it forms an adduct with boron trifluoride, of formula f3b←co.\\nadducts involving metal ions are referred to as co-ordination compounds; each ligand donates a pair of electrons to the metal ion. the reaction\\n\\n[ag(h2o)4]+ + 2nh3 → [ag(nh3)2]+ + 4h2ocan be seen as an acid–base reaction in which a stronger base (ammonia) replaces a weaker one (water)\\nthe lewis and brønsted–lowry definitions are consistent with each other since the reaction\\n\\nh+ + oh− ⇌ h2ois an acid–base reaction in both theories.\\n\\n\\n=== solvent system definition ===\\none of the limitations of the arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions. edward curtis franklin studied the acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to the water-based arrhenius theory. albert f.o. germann, working with liquid phosgene, cocl2, formulated the solvent-based theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.germann pointed out that in many solutions, there are ions in equilibrium with the neutral solvent molecules:\\n\\nsolvonium ions: a generic name for positive ions. (the term solvonium has replaced the older term lyonium ions: positive ions formed by protonation of solvent molecules.)\\nsolvate ions: a generic name for negative ions. (the term solvate has replaced the older term lyate ions: negative ions formed by deprotonation of solvent molecules.)for example, water and ammonia undergo such dissociation into hydronium and hydroxide, and ammonium and amide, respectively:\\n\\n2 h2o ⇌ h3o+ + oh−\\n2 nh3 ⇌ nh+4 + nh−2some aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation, such as dinitrogen tetroxide into nitrosonium and nitrate, antimony trichloride into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate, and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and chloride:\\n\\nn2o4 ⇌ no+ + no−3\\n2 sbcl3 ⇌ sbcl+2 + sbcl−4\\ncocl2 ⇌ cocl+ + cl−a solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvonium ions and a decrease in the concentration of solvate ions is defined as an acid. a solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvate ions and a decrease in the concentration of the solvonium ions is defined as a base.\\nthus, in liquid ammonia, knh2 (supplying nh−2) is a strong base, and nh4no3 (supplying nh+4) is a strong acid. in liquid sulfur dioxide (so2), thionyl compounds (supplying so2+) behave as acids, and sulfites (supplying so2−3) behave as bases.\\nthe non-aqueous acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water:\\n\\n2 nanh2(base) + zn(nh2)2(amphiphilic amide) → na2[zn(nh2)4]\\n2 nh4i(acid) + zn(nh2)2(amphiphilic amide) → [zn(nh3)4]i2nitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid:\\n\\nhno3(base) + 2 h2so4 → no+2 + h3o+ + 2 hso−4the unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents; for example, in liquid n2o4:\\n\\nagno3(base) + nocl(acid) → n2o4(solvent) + agcl(salt)because the solvent system definition depends on the solute as well as on the solvent itself, a particular solute can be either an acid or a base depending on the choice of the solvent: hclo4 is a strong acid in water, a weak acid in acetic acid, and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid; this characteristic of the theory has been seen as both a strength and a weakness, because some substances (such as so3 and nh3) have been seen to be acidic or basic on their own right. on the other hand, solvent system theory has been criticized as being too general to be useful. also, it has been thought that there is something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen compounds, a property not shared by non-hydrogenic solvonium salts.\\n\\n\\n=== lux–flood definition ===\\nthis acid–base theory was a revival of oxygen theory of acids and bases, proposed by german chemist hermann lux in 1939, further improved by håkon flood circa 1947 and is still used in modern geochemistry and electrochemistry of molten salts. this definition describes an acid as an oxide ion (o2−) acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor. for example:\\nmgo(base) + co2(acid) → mgco3\\ncao(base) + sio2(acid) → casio3\\nno−3(base) + s2o2−7(acid) → no+2 + 2 so2−4this theory is also useful in the systematisation of the reactions of noble gas compounds, especially the xenon oxides, fluorides, and oxofluorides.\\n\\n\\n=== usanovich definition ===\\nmikhail usanovich developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogen-containing compounds, but his approach, published in 1938, was even more general than lewis theory. usanovich\\'s theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones, and a base as the reverse. this defined the concept of redox (oxidation-reduction) as a special case of acid–base reactions\\nsome examples of usanovich acid–base reactions include:\\n\\nna2o(base) + so3(acid) → 2 na+ + so2−4 (species exchanged: o2− anion)\\n3 (nh4)2s(base) + sb2s5(acid) → 6 nh+4 + 2 sbs3−4 (species exchanged: 3 s2− anions)\\n2na(base) + cl2(acid) → 2na+ + 2cl− (species exchanged: 2 electrons)\\n\\n\\n== rationalizing the strength of lewis acid–base interactions ==\\n\\n\\n=== hsab theory ===\\n\\nin 1963, ralph pearson proposed a qualitative concept known as the hard and soft acids and bases principle. later made quantitative with help of robert parr in 1984. \\'hard\\' applies to species that are small, have high charge states, and are weakly polarizable. \\'soft\\' applies to species that are large, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable. acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard–hard and soft–soft. this theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry.\\n\\n\\n=== ecw model ===\\n\\nthe ecw model created by russell s. drago is a quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of lewis acid base interactions, −δh. the model assigned e and c parameters to many lewis acids and bases. each acid is characterized by an ea and a ca. each base is likewise characterized by its own eb and cb. the e and c parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. the equation is\\n\\n−δh = eaeb + cacb + wthe w term represents a constant energy contribution for acid–base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base. the equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. the graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of lewis base strengths or lewis acid strengths.\\n\\n\\n== acid–base equilibrium ==\\n\\nthe reaction of a strong acid with a strong base is essentially a quantitative reaction. for example,\\n\\nhcl(aq) + na(oh)(aq) → h2o + nacl(aq)in this reaction both the sodium and chloride ions are spectators as the neutralization reaction,\\n\\nh+ + oh− → h2odoes not involve them. with weak bases addition of acid is not quantitative because a solution of a weak base is a buffer solution. a solution of a weak acid is also a buffer solution. when a weak acid reacts with a weak base an equilibrium mixture is produced. for example, adenine, written as ah, can react with a hydrogen phosphate ion, hpo2−4.\\n\\nah + hpo2−4 ⇌ a− + h2po−4the equilibrium constant for this reaction can be derived from the acid dissociation constants of adenine and of the dihydrogen phosphate ion.\\n\\n[a−] [h+] = ka1[ah]\\n[hpo2−4] [h+] = ka2[h2po−4]the notation [x] signifies \"concentration of x\". when these two equations are combined by eliminating the hydrogen ion concentration, an expression for the equilibrium constant, k is obtained.\\n\\n[a−] [h2po−4] = k[ah] [hpo2−4];      k = ka1/ka2\\n\\n\\n== acid–alkali reaction ==\\n\\nan acid–alkali reaction is a special case of an acid–base reaction, where the base used is also an alkali. when an acid reacts with an alkali salt (a metal hydroxide), the product is a metal salt and water. acid–alkali reactions are also neutralization reactions.\\nin general, acid–alkali reactions can be simplified to\\n\\noh−(aq) + h+(aq) → h2oby omitting spectator ions.\\nacids are in general pure substances that contain hydrogen cations (h+) or cause them to be produced in solutions. hydrochloric acid (hcl) and sulfuric acid (h2so4) are common examples. in water, these break apart into ions:\\n\\nhcl → h+(aq) + cl−(aq)\\nh2so4 → h+(aq) + hso−4(aq)the alkali breaks apart in water, yielding dissolved hydroxide ions:\\n\\nnaoh → na+(aq) + oh−(aq)\\n\\n\\n== see also ==\\nacid–base titration\\ndonor number\\nelectron configuration\\ngutmann–beckett method\\nlewis structure\\nnucleophilic substitution and redox reactions\\nprotonation and deprotonation\\nresonance (chemistry)\\n\\n\\n== notes ==\\n\\n\\n== references ==\\n\\n\\n=== sources ===\\nclayden, jonathan;
